<p class='c'>PREFACE</p>

<p><span class="drop dca">A</span>ll boys are nature lovers. Nothing
appeals to them more than a summer
vacation in the woods where they can
escape from the restraints of civilization
and live a life of freedom. Now, it may appear to be
a bit of presumption to attempt to advise the boy
camper how to spend his time. Surely the novelty of
outdoor life, the fascinating charm of his surroundings,
will provide him plenty of entertainment.</p>

<p>But, after all, a camp generally affords but two
major amusements, hunting and fishing. These have
been fully covered by a vast number of books. However,
there is another side of camp life, particularly in
a boys&#8217; camp, which has been very little dealt with,
namely, the exercise of one&#8217;s ingenuity in creating
out of the limited resources at hand such devices and
articles as will add to one&#8217;s personal comfort and
welfare. It is, therefore, the aim of this book to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span>
suggest certain diversions of this character for the boy
camper which, aside from affording him plenty of
physical exercise, will also develop his mental faculties,
and above all stimulate that natural genius which is
characteristic of every typical American boy. To this
end the story contains descriptions of a large collection
of articles which can be made by any boy of average
intelligence, not only in the camp but at home as
well.</p>

<p>The use of a narrative to connect the various incidents
marks a departure in this class of book, and it is
believed that the matter will thus be made more
realistic and interesting. In all cases full directions
are given for making the various articles. While it is
not presumed that the directions will be slavishly
followed, for this would defeat the general aim of the
work, yet all the principal dimensions are given so
that they can be used, if desired.</p>

<p>I beg to acknowledge the courtesy of Mr. Daniel C.
Beard and Mr. Henry D. Cochrane in supplying a
number of photographs. The directions for making
the lee boards (page 119) were obtained from data
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
furnished by the latter. Many of the details recorded
in the chapter on Tramping Outfits are to be accredited
to Mr. Edward Thorpe. In the preparation of this
book I have received valuable assistance from my
colleague, Mr. A. A. Hopkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; he was it, the Scientific American Boy, I mean.
Of course, we were all American boys and pretty scientific
chaps too, if I do say it myself, but Bill, well he was the
whole show. What he didn&#8217;t know wasn&#8217;t worth knowing,
so we all thought, and even to this day I sometimes wonder
how he managed to contrive and execute so many remarkable
plans. At the same time he was not a conceited sort of a
chap and didn&#8217;t seem to realize that he was head and
shoulders above the rest of us in ingenuity. But, of course,
we didn&#8217;t all have an uncle like Bill did. Bill&#8217;s Uncle Ed
was one of those rare men who take a great interest in boys
and their affairs, a man who took time to answer every question
put to him, explaining everything completely and yet
so clearly that you caught on at once. Uncle Ed (we all
called him that) was a civil engineer of very high standing
in his profession, which had taken him pretty much all over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
the world, and his naturally inquisitive nature, coupled with a
wonderful memory, had made him a veritable walking encyclopedia.
With such an uncle it is no wonder that Bill
knew everything. Of course, there were some things that
puzzled even Bill. But all such difficulties, after a reasonable
amount of brain-work had failed to clear them, were submitted
to Uncle Ed. Uncle Ed was always prompt (that
was one thing we liked about him), and no matter where he
was or what he was doing he would drop everything to
answer a letter from the society.</p>

<p>But hold on,
I am getting
ahead of my
story. I was
rummaging
through the
attic the other
day, and came across an
old battered trunk, one
that I used when I went
to boarding-school down in south Jersey. That trunk was
certainly a curiosity shop. It contained a miscellaneous
assortment of glass tubes, brass rods, coils of wire, tools, fish
hooks&#8211;in fact, it was a typical collection of all those
&#8220;valuables&#8221; that a boy is liable to pick up. Down in one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
corner of the trunk was a black walnut box, marked, with
brass letters, &#8220;Property of the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I.&#8221;
On my key-ring I still carried the key to that box, which had
not been opened for
<span class='image-right'>

years. I unlocked
the box and
brought to light
the &#8220;Records and
Chronicles of the
Society for the
Scientific Investigation,
Exploration and Exploitation
of Willow
Clump Island.&#8221;
For hours I pored over those pages,
carried back to the good old times we used to have as boys
along the banks of the Delaware River, until I was brought
sharply back to the present by the sound of the dinner bell.
It seemed that the matter contained in those &#8220;Chronicles&#8221;
was too good to be kept locked up in an old trunk. Few
boys&#8217; clubs ever had such a president as Bill, or such a wonderful
bureau of information as Uncle Ed. For the benefit
of boys and boykind in general, I decided then and there to
publish, as fully as practicable, a record of what our
society did.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Christmas Vacation.</p>

<p>This was how the society came to be formed. Bill, whom
I met at boarding-school, was an orphan, and that&#8217;s why he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
was sent to boarding-school. His uncle had to go down to
Brazil to lay out a railroad, I believe, and so he packed Bill
off to our school, which was chosen in preference to some
others because one of the professors there had been a classmate
of Uncle Ed&#8217;s at college. Bill roomed with me, and
naturally we became great chums. When Christmas time
came, of course I invited him to spend the holidays with
me. My home was situated in the little village of Lamington,
on the Jersey side of the Delaware River. Here we
arrived late at night on the Saturday before Christmas. A
cold wind was blowing which gave promise of breaking the
spell of warm weather we had been having, and of giving
us a chance to try our skates for the first time. True to our
expectations, the next day was bitterly cold, and a visit to the
canal which ran along the river bank, just beyond our back
fence, showed that quite a thick skim of ice had formed on
the water. Monday morning, bright and early, found us
on the smooth, slippery surface of the canal. &#8220;Us&#8221; here
includes, in addition to Bill and myself, my two younger
brothers, Jack and Fred, and also Dutchy Van Syckel
and Reddy Schreiner, neighbors of ours. It was the custom
at the first of December every year to drain out most
of the water in the canal, in order to prevent possible injury
to the canal banks from the pressure of the ice. But there
was always a foot or two of water covering the bottom of
the canal, and this afforded a fine skating park of ample
width and unlimited length, while the high canal banks on
each side protected us from the bitter wind that was blowing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
Toward noon, however, the wind shifted and swept at a
terrific rate down the narrow lane between the canal banks.
We could scarcely make headway against the blow. It was
too much for Bill, who wasn&#8217;t as used to skating as we were.
He sat down in a sheltered nook and commenced to think.
When Bill sat down to think it always meant that something
was going to happen, as we soon learned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Jim,&#8221; said he to me, &#8220;have you got any canvas up
at the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;What do you want it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to rig up a skate sail. If you have an old sheet,
that will do just as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I can find you an old sheet. Do you think
you can make one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; answered
Bill, and off we went to the
house, where I received my
first lesson on the practical
genius of my chum.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>&#8220;Bill&#8217;s&#8221; Skate Sail.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>The old sheet which Mother furnished us was laid out on
the floor and two corners were folded over to the center, as
shown in the drawing, making a triangle with base 7 feet
long and sides each about 4 feet 6 inches long. The surplus
end piece was then cut off, and a broad hem turned and
basted all around the edges of the triangle. Bill wanted
to work the sewing machine himself, but Mother was
afraid he would break something, so she sewed down
the hem for us. Then, under Bill&#8217;s supervision,

<a id='link_i6'></a><img src='images/fig-004.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
she re-enforced the corners by
sewing on patches of cloth. Along
the diagonal a strip of heavy tape
was sewed, leaving loops at intervals,
which afterward were
cut and provided means for tying
the sail to the mast. Tie
strings of tape were

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 5. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s&#8221; Sail Complete.
</span>
</span>
also sewed at the corners, as shown in the
illustration, and then a trip was made to
the garden in search of suitable
spars. A smooth bean pole of
about the right weight
served for the mast,
and another stick
with a crotch at
one end served as the
boom or cross-spar. The
spars were cut to proper length,
and the sail was then tied on, as
illustrated, with the crotch of the
cross-spar fitted against and tied to
the center of the mast. A light
rope, long enough to provide plenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
of slack, was tied to the ends of the mast to assist in guiding
the sail when in use. In the meantime I had procured
another sheet from one of our neighbors, and Bill helped me
make a sail for myself. It was not until long after dark
that we finished our work.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Willow Clump Island.</p>

<p>The next day we tried the sails and it didn&#8217;t take me very
long to learn how to steer the device. The wind had changed
again and this time blew up the canal. We took the line
of least resistance, and went skimming up the ice lane like
birds for several miles before we realized how far we were
getting away from home. As we rounded a bend in the
canal, much to my astonishment, I saw just before us the
bridge at Raven Hill, eight miles from our town. We
started to go back, but the wind was too strong for us, and
there wasn&#8217;t much room in which to do any tacking; nor
could we make any progress when the sails were folded. I
began to get extremely tired and rather exasperated at Bill
for not having thought of the return trip before he led me
such a hot pace up the canal. But Bill was getting tired, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Jim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t covered a mile,
and I&#8217;m worn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in thunder didn&#8217;t you think of this before we
started?&#8221; I returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much money have you with you?&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you in a minute. How much have you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>A careful search of my dozen odd pockets netted the sum
of twenty-seven cents.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have fifty-nine,&#8221; said Bill, &#8220;and that makes eighty-six
altogether, doesn&#8217;t it? Isn&#8217;t there a railroad depot near
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one at Raven Hill, and the next is at Lumberville.
That is about eleven miles from home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bill, &#8220;at three cents each per mile that
would amount to sixty-six cents. Let&#8217;s sail on to Lumberville
and then take the train back.&#8221;</p>

<p>On we sped to Lumberville, only to find that the next train
was not due until noon, and it was now just half past ten.</p>

<p>Time never hung heavy on our hands. Out on the river
we espied an island. I had heard of this island&#8211;Willow
Clump Island, it was called&#8211;but had never been on it;
consequently I fell in with Bill&#8217;s suggestion that we make it
a visit. Owing to the rapids which separated the island
from the Jersey shore, we had to go up stream a quarter of
a mile, to where a smooth sheet of ice had formed, over a
quiet part of the river; thence we sailed down to the island
along the Pennsylvania side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a capital island for a camp,&#8221; cried Bill, after we
had explored it pretty thoroughly. &#8220;Have you ever been
out camping?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to confess I never had, and then Bill gave me a
glowing account of his experiences in the Adirondacks with
his uncle the year before, which so stirred up the romance
in me that I wanted to camp out at once.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; said Bill, &#8220;We would freeze in this kind of
weather, and besides, we&#8217;ve got to make a tent first.&#8221;</p>

<p>We then sat down and made elaborate plans for the
summer. Suddenly the distant sound of a locomotive
whistle interrupted our reveries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jiminy crickets!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;That&#8217;s the train
coming through Spalding&#8217;s Cut. We&#8217;ve got to hustle if
we are to catch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were off like the wind, and a merry chase brought us
to the Lumberville depot in time to flag the train. We
arrived at Lamington at half past twelve, a trifle late for
dinner, rather tired and hungry, but with a glowing and I
fear somewhat exaggerated account of our adventure for
the credulous ears of the rest of the boys.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Organizing the Society.</p>

<p>The camping idea met with the hearty approval of all,
and it was decided to begin preparations at once for the
following summer. Dutchy, whose father was a member
of a geographical society, suggested that we form a society
for the exploration of Willow Clump Island. By general
acclamation Bill was chosen president of the society,
Dutchy was made vice-president, Reddy was elected
treasurer, and they made me secretary. It was Dutchy
who proposed the name &#8220;The Society for the Scientific Investigation,
Exploration and Exploitation of Willow Clump
Island.&#8221; It was decided to make an expedition of exploration
as soon as we could make skate sails for the whole society.</p>

<p>The duties of the secretary, as defined in the constitution
which Dutchy Van Syckel drew up, were to keep a record
of all the acts of the society, the minutes of every meeting,
and accurate detailed descriptions of all work accomplished.
Therefore, while the rest of the society was busy cutting up
old sheets, levied from the surrounding neighborhood, and
sewing and rigging the sails under Bill&#8217;s direction, I, with
pad and pencil in hand, took notes on all the operations.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Double Swedish Sail.</p>

<p>Bill evolved some new types of sails which differed materially
from the type described in the first chapter. One
was a double sail&#8211;&#8220;the kind they use in Sweden,&#8221; he explained.
One of the
sheets which the foraging

</span>
party brought in
was extra large; it
measured approximately
two yards and
a half square. This
was folded on itself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
making a parallelogram seven feet six inches long and three
feet nine inches wide. The sheets we had were all rather worn
and some were badly torn, so that we had to make our sails
of double thickness, sewing patches over
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i9'></a><img src='images/fig-007.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
the weak spots. A broad hem was turned
down at each end, and heavy tape was
sewed on, leaving loops as before, to attach
them to the
spars. This reduced the length
of our sail to seven feet three
inches. The end spars were spaced apart by a light pole about ten feet long, to which they were
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i10'></a><img src='images/fig-008.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 8. The Double Swedish Sail.
</span>
</span>
tied at the points of intersection. The spars were also braced
by halyards looped over the ends of the pole in the manner
indicated in the drawing (Fig. 7). It took a crew of two
boys to manipulate this sail. In use, the pole of the rig was
carried on the shoulders, and the sail was guided by means
of ropes attached to the lower corners of the vertical spars.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
These ropes in nautical
language are
called &#8220;sheets.&#8221;
The boy at the rear
was the pilot and
did the steering, because
his position behind the sail gave him an unobstructed
view in all directions. When changing tack the sail was
lifted overhead to the other side of the crew.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Another sail of
similar form, but
for use of one boy
only, is shown in
Fig. 10. This had
a height of six
and one-half
feet at the forward
end and three
feet at the rear; and
its length was five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
feet. This sail was very satisfactory in light winds, owing
to its great area. In use we found that it was very important
to keep the lower edge against the leg, as indicated by the
arrow. The rig was manipulated just like the double Swedish
sail, lifting it over the head when it was desired to
change tack.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Lanteen Sail.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<a id='link_i13'></a><img src='images/fig-011.png'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
Fig 11. The Lanteen Sail.
</p>
</div>

<p>The lanteen sail we
found to be a very good
rig. It was made in
the form of a triangle,
measuring
eight feet on one
side, seven and
one-half feet on
another side and
six and one-half
feet on the third.
The six and one-half
foot side
was secured to a
boom, and the seven and one-half
foot side to a yard. The yard and
boom were hinged together by a leather strap nailed on as
shown in Fig. 12, and to this hinge a rope was attached, which
served as a sheet. These spars were secured to a mast erected
perpendicularly to the boom and intersecting the yard a little
above its center. We had had some trouble with the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
sails we made in keeping the base of the sail against the
body, and to overcome this difficulty Bill proposed tying the
<span class='image-left'>

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
bottom of the mast to the leg. This was
a rather risky thing to do, as we learned
later, for in case of accident it
would be difficult to get clear of

<a id='link_i15'></a><img src='images/fig-013.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 13. Leather Mast Step.
</span>
</span>
the sail. It
was Reddy
who finally
solved the
problem by rigging up a step for the mast.
It consisted of a leather tag tied to the leg,
and provided with a hole into which the
bottom of the mast was
fitted. To prevent the

</span>
</span>
mast from slipping too
far into the step the lower
portion of it was whittled
down, leaving a shoulder
which rested on the leather. Bill later devised
another step, which consisted of a
wooden block (Fig. 14) strapped to the leg
and formed with a shallow socket to receive
the end of the mast.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Danish Sail.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>But the most satisfactory sail we found to be the Danish
sail, though it was not until we had served quite a long
apprenticeship and

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 15. The Danish Sail.
</span>
</span>
sustained many
pretty bad falls that
we mastered the
art of manipulating
these sails
properly. Our
ideas on this sail
were obtained
from a French illustrated
paper
which Dutchy
Van Syckel picked up in his father&#8217;s library. This sail was
formed with a topsail so arranged that it could be lowered
when the wind was too strong. The dimensions of the sail
as we made it are given in the drawing
(Fig. 15). The top of the sail
was lashed to a spar, which
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i18'></a><img src='images/fig-016.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 16. Topsail of the Danish Rig.
</span>
</span>
was connected by a short
stick to another spar tied to
the mainsail about eighteen
inches lower down.
The sail was strengthened
with an extra
strip of cloth along
the lower spar,
and the tie strings
were applied in
the usual way. The connecting stick, or topmast we may
call it, was hinged to the lower spar by means of a short piece
of leather strap, which was passed round the spar in the
form of a loop and its two ends nailed to the bottom of the
topmast. The topmast extended above the upper spar a
short distance, and to this we fastened the flag which our
society had adopted. A couple of strong cords were secured
to the center spar to provide for fastening the sail onto the
skater. Tied to the lower corners of the mainsail were two
sticks which were used for guiding the sail when in flight.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>The different methods of sailing with this rig are shown in
Figs. 17-20. When sailing with the wind the skater
would stand very erect, bending backward in proportion as
the wind blew fresher. By inclining the sail in one direction
or the other, the skater could tack to port or starboard.
When moving against the wind by skating in the usual way,
the body was bent forward in such manner that the sail lay
horizontal, so that it would not offer a purchase for the wind.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Bat&#8217;s Wings.</p>

<p>One more sail deserves mention. It was Bill&#8217;s idea, and it
came near to ending his career the first day he tried it. It
had no spars at all, but was merely a strip of cloth of somewhat
triangular shape. The upper side was tied to the
head, and the two corners to the wrists, while the lower
portion was tied to the ankles. This converted him into a
huge white-winged bat. Bill had to try it at once, even
though the rest of the sails were not finished, and a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
comical spectacle he made as he flapped his wings in his
endeavors to tack. When the wind was too strong for him
he had merely to drop his arms and thus lower sail. At
length he became tired of holding his arms out at full length,
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i20'></a><img src='images/fig-021.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 21.
</span>
</span>
and I got him a stick
to put over his shoulders
and rest his arms
on. But that stick was
Bill&#8217;s undoing, for
coming around a sudden
bend in the canal
he caught the full
force of the wind,
which knocked him flat
on his back before he
could disentangle himself
from the stick and
lower sail. It took us
some time to bring him
back to consciousness,
and a very scared lot of boys we were for a while. However,
the lesson was a good one, for after that we were very
cautious in experimenting with sails that had to be tied on,
such as the Danish rig and the lanteen rig, before Reddy invented
the mast step.</p>

<p>It was not until the day after Christmas that the sails were
all completed, but then there was scarcely any wind blowing

<p>The next day, Sunday, it began to snow, and we realized
that our chance of skating up to Willow Clump Island was
spoiled. All the afternoon it snowed, and the next morning
we woke to find the ground covered to a depth of eight inches
and snow still falling. But who ever heard of a boy complaining
because there was snow on the ground? Here were
new difficulties to overcome, new problems to solve, and
new sports provided for our amusement. There was no
disappointment shown by any of the members of the S. S.
I. E. E. of W. C. I., as they met in the woodshed immediately
after breakfast to discuss proceedings for the day.
There seemed to be but one way of reaching the island, and
that was by means of snow shoes. Bill had only a vague
idea of how snow shoes were made.</p>

<p>The first pair was made from a couple of thin wooden
chair seats which we found in the shed. They proved quite
serviceable, being very light and offering a fairly large bearing
surface. The chair seats were trimmed off at each side
to make the shoes less clumsy, and a loop of leather was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
fastened near the center of each shoe, in
which the toe could be slipped. This shoe
possessed the disadvantage of being too
flat and of picking up too much snow
when used.</p>

<p>Another pair of shoes was made from
barrel staves. At first one stave was made
to serve for a shoe, but we found that two staves fastened
together with a pair of wooden cleats were much better.
Jack was the proud inventor of these shoes and insisted that
they were far more satisfactory
than the elaborate ones
which were later devised.</p>

<p>Now that Jack had shown his ingenuity,
Fred thought it was his turn to do something,
and after mysteriously disappearing for the
space of an hour we saw him suddenly come
waddling back to the shed on a pair of barrel
hoops covered with heavy canvas. He had
stretched the canvas so tightly across the
hoops that they were bent to an oval shape.
It was claimed for these shoes, and with good
reason, that they were not so slippery as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
barrel stave shoe, for they permitted the foot to sink slightly
into the snow.</p>

<p>After dinner, Dutchy came back with a book of his
father&#8217;s, a sort of an encyclopedia in which several different
kinds of snow shoes were illustrated. Reddy, whose father
owned a sawmill, volunteered to provide us with strips of
hickory from which to make the frames.</p>

<p>The Sioux snow shoe was the first type we
tackled. Two strips of hickory 4 feet long
and 3/4 inch square in section, were bent
over a pair of spreaders and securely
fastened together at each end. The
<span class='image-left'>

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 26. Frame of the Sioux Shoe.
</span>
</span>
spreaders were about 12
inches long and located
about 15 inches apart.
They were
notched at the
ends, as shown in
Fig. 26, to receive
the side strips, which were not fastened
together until after they had been nailed to the spreaders.
We found that the most satisfactory way of fastening together
the ends of the hickory strips was to bolt them together.
When the frame was completed, we began the
tedious process of weaving in the filling or web of the snow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
shoe. First we cut notches in the edges of the spreaders,
spacing these notches an inch apart. Then we procured
several balls of heavy twine at the corner store. Tying one
end of the cord to the right side stick about three inches
below the forward spreader, we stretched a strand down to
the notch at the left end of the lower spreader. The strand
was drawn taut, and after making several twists around it

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
the cord was tied to the left
side stick three inches above
the spreader. From
this point the cord
was stretched to the notch at
the right end of the upper
spreader, twisted several
times and brought back to the
starting point. The cord was
now wrapped around the side
stick for a space of about an
inch, and then carried down
to the second notch on the
lower spreader, whence it was
woven through the other two
strands and tied about the left side stick about four inches
from the spreader. Thus the weaving continued, passing
the cord alternately over and under any cross strands encountered.
In order to make the left side correspond with
the right, a separate cord was wound around it, filling up the
space between the strands of the web. The filling above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
and below the spreaders could not be so methodically done,
but we managed to weave the strands quite neatly with about
the same mesh as used at the
center. To facilitate the weaving

the two arms of the needle.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Iroquois Shoe.</p>

<p>But the best snow shoe we made was the Iroquois shoe.
The frame of this shoe was made of hickory strips of the
same width and thickness as used in the Sioux shoe, but

</span>
8 feet long. The strips were bent in a loop and the ends
were bolted together. How to bend the wood without breaking
it seemed a very difficult problem. Wood, we knew,
could be easily bent without
breaking if boiled or
steamed for a while; but
we had nothing large
enough in
which to boil a
strip of wood
8 feet long.
Bill hit upon
the plan of
wrapping the stick
with burlap and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
then pouring boiling water on it until it became sufficiently
soft to bend easily. An old oats-sack was cut up into strips
and wound onto the hickory sticks for a distance of 18
inches at each side of the center. We then repaired to the

</span>
kitchen to do the steaming. The hickory stick was held over
a large dish-pan filled with boiling water, and from this we
dipped out the water and
poured it slowly over the
burlap wrapping of the
stick. After a little of this
treatment the stick was sufficiently
steamed to permit
of bending to the required shape. The ends

were then firmly secured by means of bolts
passed through bolt holes which had been
previously drilled. The frame was completed
by fitting the spreader sticks in place,
after which it was laid away to dry. When
the frame was perfectly dry we started
weaving the web. In this case, however,
instead of cord we used cane strips, which
we had bought from a chair caner. This
necessitated drilling holes in the side sticks
to receive the cane strips. The web consisted
of strands crossing each other diagonally,
as illustrated. Our second pair
of Iroquois snow shoes was made with a web of rawhide
which we bought from a hardware store at Millville.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Ainu Snow Shoe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>One of the snowshoes described in the book was very much
like Fred&#8217;s barrel-hoop snow shoe in appearance. According
to the description, it was a type used by the Ainus, a peculiar
people living in the cold northern islands of Japan. As the
shoe seemed quite simple and rather unique, we thought we

would make one like it. Two hickory
strips each 4 feet long were bent to a
U-shape and lashed together, forming
an oval about 2 feet 6 inches long by 18
inches wide. The frame was held to
oval shape by tying the sides together.
Then the filling was woven in, running
the strands diagonally, as shown in
Fig. 32.</p>

<p>We had excellent weather for snow
shoes after that snowstorm. A thaw
followed by a cold spell caused a thick crust to form on the
snow which would nearly hold us up without the aid of our
snowshoes. We were rather awkward with those shoes for
a while, trying to keep them clear of each other, and we
found it particularly hard to turn sharply without causing one
shoe to run foul of the other. But with a little practice we
soon felt quite at home on them. In order to prevent cutting
the web with our heels, we found it necessary to wear
rubbers.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Norwegian Ski.</p>

<p>The Norwegian ski was made of close-grained wood, 1

inches from the forward end the wood was planed down to
a thickness of 1/4 of an inch. This end was placed in the

end of the shoe between
the banisters
on the back porch
and nailing a cleat back of the heel end. When the ski was
perfectly dry the toe strap was nailed on just back of the
balancing point, and also another strap, to be secured about
the ankle. Then a cleat was nailed onto the ski to fit against
the heel of the shoe. In use we found it best to cut a groove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
in the bottom of the ski, so as to give us a better
grip on the snow in climbing up hills. With the
skis we had to use short poles or &#8220;ski sticks&#8221; to assist
in starting, stopping and steering when coasting.
The ski stick was a bean pole provided with a wooden
block near the lower end, to prevent it from being
forced too far through the snow.</p>

<p>The Swiss shoe was made

distance up the river from our

shoes were made from the
bottoms of two old baskets, and they
worked so admirably that it was decided
to equip the whole society with
them. Uncle Ed, when told about them, informed us that
that was the kind of snow shoe used in Switzerland. Of
course, we could not afford to destroy a pair of baskets for
each member of the club, and so we had to weave the shoes
from the willows which grew on the island.</p>

<p>We had a farewell meeting of the society the evening
before Bill and I had to return to boarding-school. At this
meeting plans were made for the Easter vacation. We also
considered the matter of getting parental permission for our
summer outing. So far we had been afraid to breathe a
word of our plans outside of the society, since Fred had said
something about it in the presence of Father and had been
peremptorily ordered to banish all such hair-brained, Wild
West notions from his head. We realized from that incident
that the consent of our parents would not be so very easily
obtained. But Bill came forward with a promising suggestion.
He would write to his Uncle Ed and see if he couldn&#8217;t
be persuaded to join the expedition. At first we demurred.
We didn&#8217;t want a &#8220;governor&#8221; around all the time. But
Bill assured us that his uncle was &#8220;no ordinary man&#8221;; that
he would not interfere with our plans, but would enter right
into them and give us many valuable pointers. Though not
by any means convinced, we told him to go ahead and invite
his uncle, as that seemed about the only means of winning
over our fathers and mothers. The society was then adjourned
until our Easter vacation began, each member
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
promising to earn and save as much money as he could in the
meantime to buy the materials for a tent and provisions for
the summer outing.</p>

<p>Bill&#8217;s letter to Uncle Ed was answered as quickly as the
mail could travel to Brazil and back. Uncle Ed heartily approved
of our plans, and said that he would be delighted to
join the expedition. He could not be on hand before the
1st of July, but that would give us plenty of time to make all
necessary preparations. He told us not to worry about
gaining the consent of our parents. He would write to
them and see them all personally, if necessary to win their
approval.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>When at last spring arrived and we returned to Lamington
on our Easter vacation, quite a sum of money had been
collected, nearly $15.00, if I remember rightly; at any rate
plenty to buy the materials for a good-sized tent and leave a
large surplus for provisions,

etc. Bill figured out on paper
just how much canvas we
would need for a tent 7 feet
wide by 9-1/2 feet long, which
he estimated would be about
large enough to hold us.
It took 34 yards, 30
inches wide. Then we
visited the village store to make our purchase. Canvas we
found a little too expensive for us, but a material called drill
seemed about right. It cost ten cents a yard, but since we
wanted such a quantity of it the price was reduced to a total
of $3.00. We repaired to the attic to lay out the material.</p>

<p>First we cut out four lengths of 5 yards and 26 inches
each. The strips were basted together, lapping the edges

1 inch and making a piece 17 feet 2 inches long by 9 feet 9
inches wide. Mother sewed the breadths together on the
machine, using a double seam, as in sail making; that is, two
parallel rows of stitching were sewed in, one along each
overlapping edge, as shown in Fig. 38. A 1-inch hem was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
then turned and sewed at the
ends of the goods, so that the
piece measured exactly 17 feet
long. It served for the roof
and side walls of the tent.
Our next operation was to cut
three strips 11 feet long, and
sew them together with a
double seam as before. This
piece was now slit along the
center line <i>m</i>, Fig. 39, making
two lengths 3 feet 8
inches wide. The strips were
then cut along the diagonal lines <i>a a</i>, forming the
end walls or doors, so to speak, of the tent. In sewing

on the door flaps we

bottom of the side
<i>c</i>, sewing it to the
side edge of the
main piece, as shown
in Fig. 40, and running
the seam up for
a distance of exactly
3 feet 6 inches.
After all the door
strips had been
sewed along their <i>c</i>
edges the sewing was continued up the diagonal or <i>a</i> edges.
In cutting out the door pieces we had allowed 1 inch on each
side for hems and seams, so that the door pieces met without
lapping at the exact center of the main or body piece, that is,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>

<p>Our next step was to fasten the necessary ropes and loops.
Ten 8-foot lengths of light rope were procured. These
were fastened at the top of the side walls, that is, 3 feet 6
inches from the ends of the main or body piece, one at each
corner and one on each seam. The cloth was

strengthened at these points with
patches sewed on the inside. At
the bottom of the side walls we
sewed on loops of heavy tape.
These were spaced about 15 inches
apart. Along the <i>b</i> edges of the door pieces tie strings of
tape were fastened. A rope 15 feet long was attached to
the peak at the front and at the rear of the tent. The front
and rear posts of the tent were made from scantlings measuring
2 by 4 inches, which were procured from Mr. Schreiner&#8217;s
lumber yard. They were planed smooth and sawed off to a
length of 7 feet 6 inches. A slot was cut in the end of each
stick to a depth of 6 inches and measuring slightly over an

inch in width. For the ridge pole a strip 1 inch thick, 2-1/2
inches wide and 10 feet long was secured. This was fitted
into the slotted ends of these posts, where it was fastened
by wooden pegs slipped into holes drilled through the ends
of the posts and the ridge pole. A number of these peg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
holes were provided, so that if the canvas stretched the ridge
pole could be raised or lowered to prevent the walls from
dragging on the ground. We set up the tent in our back
yard to see if it was properly constructed. Twelve stakes
were required, ten for the sides and one for the ridge stays
at the front and rear. The side stakes were driven into the
ground at a distance of about 8 feet from the center of the
tent. First we tied the guy ropes to the stakes, but later we
found it much easier to secure them with tie blocks.</p>

threaded. A knot in the rope then held the end from slipping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
out. The loop between the two holes, or the bight, as
sailors would call it, was now slipped over the stake, and
the rope hauled tight by drawing up the tie block, as shown
in Fig. 43. A still later improvement consisted in making
ties of stout galvanized
iron wire, bent to the form
shown in Fig. 44. The
wooden ties were apt to

exposed to the weather, while the wire ties could always be
relied upon.</p>

<p>The walls of the tent were held down along the bottom
by railway spikes hooked through the tent loops and driven
into the ground. Wooden pegs with notches to catch the
loops would have served as well, but Dutchy happened to
find a number of the spikes along the track and in his usual
convincing manner argued that they were far better than
pegs because their weight would hold the cloth down even if
they were not firmly embedded in the ground.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Annex.</p>

<p>We were surprised to find out how small the tent was
after it was set up. We could see at once that when we had
put in all the stores and provisions we would need, there
would not be room enough for six boys and a man to stretch
themselves out comfortably in it. Bill had evidently made
a miscalculation, but he suggested that we remedy the error
by building an annex for our kitchen utensils and supplies.</p>

hemmed to make a piece 17 feet long and 4 feet 9 inches
wide. Tape loops were then sewed on as before, and ropes
were fastened on at the top of the side walls, that is, 3 feet
6 inches from the ends of the strips. We thought it would
be better to have a slanting ridge on the annex, so we cut out
a wedge-shaped piece from the center of the two strips, as
shown by dotted lines <i>B B</i> in Fig. 46. This wedge-shaped
piece measured 2 feet at the outer end of the annex, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
tapered down to a point at the inner end. The canvas was
then sewed together along these edges. Tie strings were
sewed to the inner edge of the annex and corresponding ones
were attached to the main tent a little ways back from the
edge, so that the two could be tied together, with the annex
lapping well over on the roof and side walls. A notch was
cut out of the peak of the annex, so that it could be tied
around the rear post of the tent, and notches were cut at
the top of the side walls to permit passing the cloth around
the wall ropes. Instead of supporting the ridge of the annex
on a ridge pole, we used the rear guy line of the tent, propping
it up with a scantling about 5-1/2 feet long.</p>

<p>School closed on the 21st of June that year, just ten days
before the expected arrival of Uncle Ed. The first thing we
did was to set up our tent in the back yard and camp out so
as to become acclimatized. It is good that we did this, for
the very first night a heavy summer shower came up which
nearly drenched us. The water beat right through the thin
canvas roof of our tent. Had we been able to afford the
best quality of canvas duck, such an occurrence would probably
have been avoided. But we solved the difficulty by using
a tent fly; that is, a strip of canvas stretched over the tent
and spaced a short distance from it to break the fall of the
rain drops.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>Again we had to visit the village
storekeeper; this time we bought out
his whole remaining stock, sixteen
yards of drill. This was cut into
four-yard strips, which were sewed together as before and
the ends turned up and hemmed. Tie strings were sewed to
the ends of the strips so that the fly could be tied to the wall
ropes of the tent. At the ridge the fly was supported about
six inches above the tent rope by a second ridge pole held by
pegs in the top holes of the tent posts.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Provisions and Supplies.</p>

<p>The ten days before Uncle Ed arrived were busy indeed.
We had to gather together the necessary provisions and supplies.
Our personal outfits were very simple. Each member
supplied himself with a change of underwear, a bathing suit,
a blanket and a toothbrush. A single comb and brush
served for the entire society, and was used on Sundays, the
only day we really dressed up. All the rest of the time we
lived in our bathing suits, except, of course, on cold rainy
days. Our kitchen outfit consisted of a large cooking pot,
two kettles, a frying pan, a coffee pot, a small oil stove, a
half-dozen each of plates, cups, saucers, knives and forks, a
dozen spoons, two tablespoons, and, in addition, several large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
plates and bowls for pantry use. We also took with us a
dish-pan and several dish-towels. For our larder we collected
the following: A bag of flour, ten pounds of sugar,
two pounds of salt, three pounds of coffee, four pounds of
oatmeal, four pounds of butter, two pounds of lard, six
pound of beans, six pounds of rice, three pounds of bacon,
six cans of condensed milk, a dozen eggs, box of pepper, and
several jars of canned peaches and pears, and also a half
dozen glasses of jelly.</p>

<p>It was Dutchy who suggested that we have a chicken yard,
in connection with our camp, to supply us with fresh eggs.
It was a capital idea, and by the dint of some coaxing we
managed to secure the loan of a half dozen hens and a
rooster.</p>

<p>Our miscellaneous list included a spade, pick and shovel,
an ax, a hatchet, two large pails, a barn lantern, a can of
kerosene, a dozen candles, a cocoa box filled with matches, a
pair of scissors, needles, buttons, pins and safety pins, a
spool of white and another of black cotton, fishing tackle,
a roll of heavy twine, a coil of rope, and a set of dominoes
and checkers. But most important of all was a chest of
tools belonging to Reddy. These were all collected when
Uncle Ed arrived. Dutchy also contributed a large compass,
which we found very useful later on, for surveying the island.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Crossbow.</p>

<p>Reddy had a shotgun which he wanted to bring along,
but my father, and Dutchy&#8217;s as well, wouldn&#8217;t let us go camping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
if there was to be any gunpowder along, so we had to
leave it behind. Of course we didn&#8217;t miss it at all when we
got to the island, because there was so much else to do;
but we all agreed with Dutchy, that &#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t be no sort
of a scientific expedition without takin&#8217; a gun along.&#8221; As a
substitute I suggested a bow and arrow. They all laughed
at such a &#8220;kiddish&#8221; idea; all but Bill, I mean.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t such a bad notion,&#8221; said he, &#8220;only a crossbow
would be better. I&#8217;ve seen them made out of umbrella
ribs so they&#8217;d shoot like greased lightning.&#8221; Of course we
had to have one of these wonderful weapons. Down in the
ash heap we found two broken
umbrellas with 27-inch ribs. Bill
selected ten good ribs, from which
he wrenched off the spreaders with
a pair of pliers. The ribs were
then bound together by winding

</span>
</span>
stout twine around them. The winding was very evenly
and closely done, so that the cord completely covered the
ribs, making a solid rod of spring steel. But before winding
we had laid in between the ribs a piece of heavy twine, to
which the bowstrings could be tied after the bow was all
wound. The stock of our crossbow was cut out of a board
<span class='image-right'>

of soft wood 1 inch thick to as near the shape of a gun as
we could get it. A hole was drilled through the muzzle
end to receive the bow, and then the bowstring was tied fast.
Along the upper edge of the barrel a V-shaped channel was
cut. The channel was not very deep, only enough to receive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
a tenpenny nail with the head projecting half-way above the
sides. A notch was cut across the barrel, through this channel,
at the trigger end, and a trigger made of heavy iron wire,
bent to the shape shown in Fig. 51,
was hinged to the gun by a bolt
which passed clear
through the stock and
through both eyes of the
trigger. By using two nuts on the bolt,
and tightening one against the other,
they were prevented from working loose
and coming off. When we wanted to fire the gun the bowstring
was drawn back, and held by slipping it into the notch,
<span class='image-left'>

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
and a nail was laid
in the channel with
its head against the
bowstring. Then, on
pulling the trigger, the
bowstring was lifted out of the notch, and sent the nail off
sailing. The long-grooved barrel insured a
very good aim.</p>

<p>Another device we made in preparation
for the expedition was a megaphone.
A sheet of light cardboard 30 inches
square was procured. At the center of
one edge a pin was stuck into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
cardboard, then a piece of stout thread was looped over
the pin and the two ends were knotted together just

pin. Another
knot was also
made 29 inches
from the pin.
Now, with a pencil
hooked into
the loop, and resting
first against
the inner knot
and then against
the outer one, two
arcs were drawn
on the paper, one of 5-inch radius and the other of 29-inch
radius. A line was now drawn from the pin to the point
where the longer arc met the right hand edge of the paper,
and a dotted line was drawn from the pin to a point

1-1/2 inches from the edge at the

1 inch to the left of the pin we
then drew a line to the left end of
the arc. With a scissors we cut the cardboard

but the dotted line, leaving a piece of the
shape shown in Fig. 55. This piece was
rolled into a cone with the right edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
lapped over the left edge and lying against the dotted line.
In this position it was held by means of several brass fasteners
of the kind shown in Fig. 56.</p>

<p>A mouthpiece was formed out of a block of wood in which
a large hole had been drilled. The block was then cut away
until the walls were quite thin. The hole was reamed
out at the top, as shown in Fig. 57, and the outer surface
was tapered so that the small end of the megaphone would
fit snugly on it.</p>

<p>We planned to reach our camping grounds by way of the
canal, and had provided for that purpose a large scow, which
we expected to tow up to Lumberville and drag over to the
river.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Scow.</p>

<p>Our scow was made as follows: Two 3/4-inch pine boards,
12 inches wide and 12 feet long, were selected from Reddy&#8217;s

</span>
father&#8217;s lumber pile. These were used for the side pieces
of the boat, and we tapered
them off at the end to a width
of 3-1/2 inches. This was done
by making a straight cut from the end to a point three feet
back along the edge of the board and then rounding off the
edge with a draw-knife. When one board had been shaped,
it was used as a pattern for the other, which was thus cut to
exactly the same size. For the end pieces two strips, 4
inches wide and 2 feet 10-1/2 inches long, were sawed out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
a 1-inch board. Then for the bottom we procured a number
of 3/4-inch boards, 12 feet long and 8 inches wide, which
we cut into 3-foot lengths. At Bill&#8217;s suggestion, before

nailing the parts together, we secured some strips of flannel,
which were saturated
with paint,
and laid between the
seams so as to make
the boat perfectly
water-tight. The side and end boards were then nailed
together, with the strips of flannel between, the side boards
overlapping the end boards, as shown in Fig. 59. After

edges laid flush with
the edges of the side
pieces, the bottom
boards were nailed on, strips of cloth being inserted between
them, as well as along the edges of the side and end boards.
To brace the bottom a 3/4-inch board was placed at the
center, inside the boat, and bent down against the floor, to
which it was nailed with wire
nails. The nails were driven

two strips 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick were nailed. Two
notches were cut in the inner side of each strip before it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>

to receive the rowlocks. A strip was also nailed
across the stern of the boat and formed with two
central notches, to receive the rowlocks for a
steering oar. This strip, however, was 3 inches
wide, and projected 1 inch above the end board,
so as to lie flush with the deck boards, which were
later applied. Six thole pins, 1/2 inch thick, 4-1/2
inches long and 2 inches
wide, were cut out of an
oak board. The lower

to a width of 1-1/2
inches for a length of 2
inches. The thole pins
were then fitted snugly in the notches. Two cleats, nailed
to the side boards inside, 7 inches below the upper edge,
served to support a seat board 1 inch thick and 2 feet 10-1/2
inches long. The aft edge of the seat was about 10 inches
forward of the rowlocks. The boat was completed by nailing
on a couple of deck boards at each end. The oars were
made of 2-inch pine boards, 5 feet long and 5 inches wide.

<p>The morning of July 2d dawned bright and clear, but
long before daybreak the members of the S. S. I. E. E. of
W. C. I. were astir. The jolly red sun peeping over the
eastern hills witnessed an unaccustomed sight. Six greatly
excited boys were running back and forth from the barn to
the canal, bearing all manner of mysterious bundles, which
were carefully deposited in a freshly painted scow. Yes,
all six of us were there.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Unique Alarm Clock.</p>

<p>We hadn&#8217;t expected to see Reddy Schreiner at such an
early hour, for he was always a sleepyhead, and no alarm
clock would ever wake him. But this was an exceptional day,
and, besides, Reddy was quite an original chap. He had
taken one of the borrowed roosters into his room the night
before, and when, early in the morning, Mr. Chanticleer had
mounted the footboard of the bed, flapped his wings and
given vent to his opinion of a boy who persisted in sleeping
at that late hour of the day, the noise was too much for even
Reddy&#8217;s drowsy sensibilities.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>Our scow was not large enough to carry all the things we
had to take with us, but as Mr. Schreiner was going to take
Uncle Ed up in his wagon, we left the rest of our luggage for
him to bring along. We boys walked the eleven miles up the
canal to Lumberville, towing the barge. It was a tiresome
task; but we divided the work into two-mile shifts, two boys
towing at a time and then each taking a mile ride as steersman
in the boat. It was about noon when we arrived at
Lumberville, and then we had to unload our boat before we
could haul it out of the canal and down to the river. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
river on the Jersey side of the island was so shallow that we
waded across, pushing the boat ahead of us. The current
was too swift to permit of rowing, and it was rather hard for
us to keep our footing. But we managed to reach our destination
finally without any mishap. The island was thickly
wooded, except for a small clearing where we landed. The
first thing we did was to unpack our eatables, and Jack, the
cook, soon had an appetizing pan of bacon and eggs sputtering
on the kerosene stove.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Preliminary Exploration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>As no better position offered at the time we pitched our
tent in the clearing, pending a thorough search for a more
suitable place elsewhere. Around the tent we dug a trench
about a foot deep to prevent water from entering our quarters
when it rained. It was about time for Uncle Ed and
Mr. Schreiner to appear with the rest of our luggage, so we
did not have time to do much exploring, but sauntered southward
along the shore, always on the lookout for their arrival.
About a quarter of a mile from the tent we came across the
wreck of an old bridge, which had been washed down by
some freshet. This was a great find, and served us many
purposes, as will appear later.</p>

<p>While we were examining the wreck we heard a distant
&#8220;halloa&#8221; from the mainland. There was Uncle Ed sitting
on a pile of goods on the railroad bank looking for all the
world like an Italian immigrant. We answered with a shout
and scrambled back to the clearing. Then we ran splashing
through the water, pushing the boat before us. It didn&#8217;t
take us long to load up and carry him back to the island.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Rustic Table.</p>

<p>Uncle Ed entered into our fun at once. He was as enthusiastic
as a boy over the surroundings, and when we told
him of the old bridge he started right off to investigate,

taking the ax with him. Soon he

had pried off a number of the
planks, which we used
for a flooring to our
tent. Then he built
us a table out of four
forked sticks, driven
into the ground, and
supporting two
cross sticks, on
which a pair of
planks were laid.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Small Filter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, boys,&#8221; said Uncle Ed, wiping the perspiration
from his forehead, &#8220;I am as thirsty as a whale. Where
do you get your drinking water? Is there a spring on the
island?&#8221;</p>

<p>We told him that we used the river water.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, river water! That won&#8217;t do at all,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll all have the typhoid fever. We must build a filter.

Fig. 68. The Small Filter.
</span>
</span>
I brought some charcoal with me for this very purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking one of our pails he broke a hole in the bottom of
it and stuffed a sponge in the hole. A layer of small stones
was then placed in the pail, over this a layer of broken charcoal
with the dust carefully blown out, then a layer of clean
sand, and finally a layer of gravel. Each layer was about two
inches thick. The pail was suspended from a branch in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
cool place and proved an excellent filter, the water trickling
out through the sponge being perfectly pure and sweet, no
matter how dirty it had been when
poured in; but the capacity
of the filter was too small,
and Uncle Ed said he would
make us a larger one on the
morrow if no spring was discovered
in the meantime.</p>

<p>The sun was getting low in the
west, and we therefore postponed
the exploration of our island until
the following day. We had been
up since four o&#8217;clock that morning
and had done some pretty hard
work; so, immediately after
supper, we turned in and,
lulled by the murmuring of
the river, were soon fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast the next day we started out in
two parties to search the island. The only discovery of any

</span>
moment was that made by Dutchy&#8217;s party, which found a
small island separated from ours by a narrow channel,
through which the water ran like a mill-race. No spring was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
discovered, so Uncle Ed had to construct his large filter.
Bill and I went over to Lumberville in search of a couple of
cider barrels and a pailful of charcoal. The barrels were
placed one on top of the other after cutting a large hole in the
top of the lower barrel, and a smaller one in the bottom of the
upper one. The latter opening
was covered by an inverted
saucer. Over this we spread a
3-inch layer of coarse sand, then
a 2-inch layer of charcoal, a 4-inch
layer of clear, sharp sand,
and a 2-inch top layer of gravel.
The lower barrel was provided
with a faucet, through which we
could draw off the filtered water
as desired. In order to keep the
water cool we placed the filters
in a shady place near the river,
and piled up earth around the
lower barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Uncle Ed,
&#8220;form in line there, and we will
go through a fire drill.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arranged us about five feet
apart in a line extending from
the filter to the river. We had six pails, and these Dutchy
filled one at a time, passing them up the line to Reddy, who
emptied them into the upper barrel and then threw them back

long to fill up the filter, and the burden of keeping the barrels
full, instead of falling on one person, was shared alike by all.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The <i>Klepalo</i>.</p>

<p>Our camp outfit was further augmented by a dinner call.
We discovered the necessity of such a call on our very first
day of camping. Dutchy was so excited by his discoveries
of the morning that he started out alone in the afternoon to
make a further search. The rest of us were lazy after the
noon meal, and were lolling around taking it easy during the
heat of the day, and discussing plans for the future. But
Dutchy&#8217;s energetic nature would not permit him to keep
quiet. He took the scow and waded with it against the
strong current to the deeper and quieter water above the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
island. Then he rowed a long way up stream. He was gone
all the afternoon. Supper time came and still he didn&#8217;t appear.
The sun was high, and I presume he didn&#8217;t realize
how late it was getting. Finally, just at sunset, he came
drifting down with the current, tired and hungry, and ready
for a large meal. But we had finished our supper an hour
before, and poor Dutchy had to be content with a few cold
remnants, because the cook had declared he wouldn&#8217;t prepare
an extra meal for a fellow who didn&#8217;t have sense enough
to know when it was meal time.</p>

<p>Then it was that Uncle Ed bethought himself of the
<i>klepalo</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have some sort of a dinner call,&#8221; he declared,
&#8220;so that any one within a mile of camp will know
when dinner is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of a <i>klepalo</i>? No? Well, I was
down in Macedonia a couple of years ago inspecting a railroad,
and I stopped off for the night at a small Bulgarian
village. The next day happened to be a <i>Prasdnik</i>, or
saint&#8217;s day, and the first thing in the morning I was awakened
by a peculiar clacking sound which I couldn&#8217;t make out. Calling
my interpreter I found out from him that it was a <i>klepalo</i>
for calling the people to church. The people there are too
poor to afford a bell, and so in place of that they use a beam
of oak hung from a rope tied about the center, and this beam
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i75'></a><img src='images/illus-075.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
The <i>Klepalo</i>.
</span>
</span>
is struck with a hammer, first on one side, and then the other.
Sometimes an iron <i>klepalo</i> is used as well, and then they
strike first the beam and then the iron bar, so as to vary the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
monotony of the call. I found that the wooden <i>klepalo</i> could
be heard for a distance of about one and a half miles over
land, and the iron one for over two miles. Now we can easily
make a wooden <i>klepalo</i> for use in this camp, and then if
Dutchy, or any of the rest of us, keep within a mile and a
half of camp there won&#8217;t be any trouble with the cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>So we built a <i>klepalo</i>, getting from Lumberville a stick of
seasoned oak, 1-1/2 inches thick, 6 inches wide and 4 feet long.
A hole was drilled into the stick at the center, and by a rope
passed through this hole the beam was suspended from a
branch overhanging the camp. Jack, the cook, regularly
used this crude device to call the hungry horde to meals.</p>

<p>One of the first things we did after getting fairly settled
in our new quarters was to make a complete survey of Willow
Clump Island and its immediate surroundings. Our surveying
instruments were made as follows:</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Surveying Instrument.</p>

<p>Out of a 1-inch board we cut a base 15 inches long and
4 inches wide. In the center we sawed out a circular opening
of about 3 inches diameter and covered this at the bottom by

</span>
a circular piece 1 inch
thick and 5 inches in
diameter, thus forming
a socket in which our
compass fitted snugly.
A hole 1 inch in diameter
was drilled through the center of this circular piece
to receive the pivot pin of a tripod. Across each end of the
baseboard we secured a block 4 inches long, 2 inches wide
and 1 inch thick. A 1-inch sight hole was drilled through
each block at its center. A ring of cardboard, on which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
Uncle Ed marked with radial lines the 360 degrees of the
circle, was placed over the compass socket, with the zero and
180 degree marks pointing toward the sight blocks. The

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 72. Sighting Blocks on the Baseboard.
</span>
</span>
outer faces of the end blocks were now wet with mucilage
and a hair was stretched vertically across the center of each
sight hole. The hairs were then adjusted by
sighting through the holes and moving the
nearer hair sidewise until it was exactly in line
with both the zero and the 180 degree
marks on the cardboard.
Then a hair
was stretched horizontally
across the
center of each sight
hole. Great care
was taken to place
the hairs at exactly the same height above the baseboard.
To protect the hairs after they were adjusted, they were covered
with a piece of glass, which was secured in place by
tacks driven into the wood with their heads projecting over
the edges of the glass.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Spirit Levels.</p>

<p>From one of his pockets Uncle Ed produced two small
bottles, the kind used for holding homeopathic pills. These
he filled nearly to the top with water, corked them and
wedged them into grooves cut lengthwise in the baseboard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
at opposite sides of the cardboard ring. These grooves
were filled with putty, and to make sure that the bottles were
level with the baseboard the latter was floated on a bit of
quiet water and the bottles were pressed down at one end or
the other until the bubble within rested at the exact center.</p>

<p>The tripod head was
formed of a wooden disk 5
inches in diameter, with a
wooden pin projecting
from its center
adapted to engage
the hole in the circular
piece above
referred to. To the
bottom of the tripod head were nailed three blocks

</span>
2 inches long and 1 inch square in cross-section. The
tripod legs were made of light strips of wood, 3/8
inch by 1 inch by 5 feet long, which we secured from
one of the mills at Lumberville. Each leg was
formed of two of these strips, nailed securely together
to within 20 inches of the top. At the upper
ends the strips were spread to receive the blocks on
the tripod head. In this position they were held by
headless wire nails driven into the ends of the blocks
and fitting into holes drilled in the strips. For a

tacked a cord to the
center of the tripod
head, and attached
a good-sized sinker to its
lower end. In connection with
this plumb line we occasionally
used a protractor consisting of
a semicircle of cardboard 5
inches in diameter, on which
the degrees of the circle

were marked off with radiating
lines, as illustrated in
Fig. 76. By holding the
straight edge of this protractor
against the base of
the tripod, and noting the number of degrees between the
90 degree mark and the plumb line, we could tell at a glance
at what angle from the horizontal the instrument was tipped.</p>

Fig. 77. The Surveyor&#8217;s Chain.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>We made a surveyor&#8217;s chain of wire links, each 12
inches long, instead of 7.92 inches, which is the length of a
standard surveyor&#8217;s link. The wire we used was No. 16
galvanized iron, which was rather stiff and difficult to bend.
In order to make all the links of exactly the same size and
shape we used a form, around which they were bent. The

</span>
form consisted of a 1-inch board in which two 1/2 inch holes
were drilled, just 11-1/2 inches apart, measured from their
centers. An oak pin, 1/2 inch in diameter, was driven into
each hole and projected about an inch above the board. Two
blocks of oak were secured to the baseboard, just before each
pin, as shown in Fig. 78. This form gave great satisfaction.
A groove was cut in the side of one of the pins to receive the

this ring and bent around the peg to form the ring of the
new link. After each link was formed it was carefully measured,
and, if too long, was shortened by flattening the rings
endwise, or, if too short, was lengthened by pinching together
the sides of the rings. There were fifty links in our
chain, and every tenth one was formed with a double ring
at the end, so as to distinguish it from the rest (see Fig. 79).</p>

<p>We completed our outfit by making
a surveyor&#8217;s rod out of a straight
stick of wood about 6 feet long. A
target or sighting disk was mounted
on the stick. This disk was 6 inches
in diameter, and was sawed out of a
6-inch square board by making

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 81. The Sighting Disk
</span>
</span>
straight cuts across the corners and then smoothing off the
edge to a perfect circle with a draw-knife. The thickness of
the disk was only 1/2 inch. At the back of the disk we fastened
a block of wood with a slot cut in it to receive the rod,
as shown in Fig. 81. To hold the disk at different heights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
on the rod a small bolt was used. The nut on this bolt was
slipped into a hole on the block at the bottom of the slot and

</span>
held in place by driving in nails about it, as illustrated in
Fig. 82. The bolt was then passed through
the hole and threaded through the nut, with
its inner end bearing against the rod. The
disk could thus be held at any desired position
by tightening up the bolt. A piece of
white paper was now pasted over the disk.
The paper was marked off into quarters,
and opposite quarters were
painted black so that it would
be easy to sight, from a distance, the exact center
of the target.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Simple Method of Surveying.</p>

<p>Of course, none of us had studied trigonometry,
but Uncle Ed devised a very simple method by
which we could determine distances quite accurately without
much figuring.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will tell me the length of one side of a triangle and
the angles it makes with the other two sides,&#8221; said Uncle Ed,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you the length of the other two sides and the size
of the third angle. This is how I will do it:</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<a id='link_i88'></a><img src='images/fig-083.png'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
Fig. 83. Diagram of Our First Lesson in Surveying.
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Say the line is 6 inches long and one angle is 35 degrees,
while the other is 117 degrees. Let us draw a 6-inch straight
line. This we will call our base line. Now we will place the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
base edge of our protractor on the base line with its center at
the right hand end of the line. At the 37 degree mark we
will make a dot on the paper so, and draw a line from the
right hand end of the base line through this dot. Now we
will do the same thing at the opposite end, making a dot at
107 degrees from the line, and draw
a line from the left hand end of
the base line through this dot.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we extend these lines until they intersect,
we will have the required
triangle, and can measure the two sides, which will be
found to be about 12 inches and 8 inches long, and the third
angle will measure just 26 degrees. It doesn&#8217;t make any
difference on what scale we draw the triangle, whether it be
miles, yards, feet, inches or fractions of an inch, the proportions
will be the same. If the base line had been 6 half-inches,
or 3 inches long, and the same angles were used, the
other two lines would measure 12 half-inches, or six inches,
and 8 half-inches, or 4 inches. If the base line were 6 quarter-inches
long, the sides would be 3 inches and 2 inches long.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>&#8220;Now, for example, I am going to measure the distance
to that tree over there. Get out your chain and measure off
a straight line 10 feet long. Now, I&#8217;ll set the surveying
instrument with the plumb-bob right over the end of this
line, and sight through the two sight holes until I bring the
two vertical hairs in line with each other and the tree. Look
at the compass needle. It points to the 173 degree mark on
the cardboard ring. Now, Bill, you hold the rod at the other
end of our base line while I swing this instrument around
and sight it. There, the needle points to 92 degrees, and
subtracting this from 173 the difference, 81 degrees, is the
angle at the right end of our base line. We&#8217;ll do the same
thing at the other end of our line. See, the compass needle
points to 189 degrees, and now sighting to the pole at the
other end of the line we find that the needle points to 268.
The difference, 79 degrees, is therefore the size of the angle
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i89'></a><img src='images/fig-084.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 84. Determining the Distance to the Tree.
</span>
</span>
at the left end of our base line. Now we will draw this out
on paper, as we did our first triangle, using quarter-inches to
represent feet. Our base line was 10 feet long, and we will
therefore draw a line 10 quarter-inches, or 2-1/2 inches long,
on our drawing board. On this line we will construct the
triangle, using the angles 81 and 79 degrees. There, that&#8217;s
how our triangle looks, and the right hand side measures
7-1/4 inches, while the left hand side measures 7-5/16 inches.
That is, 29 quarter-inches for one side and 29-1/4 quarter-inches
for the other. As each quarter-inch represents a foot,
you will find that the tree is about 29 feet from the right
end of our base line and 29 feet 3 inches from the left hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
end. Of course, our instrument is not perfect, neither is our
drawing; but if you measure it off with the chain you will
see that I am not very far from correct.&#8221;</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Mapping the Island.</p>

<p>Most of our surveying was done by actual measurement,
the surveying instrument being used only to determine the
exact direction of the measurement. However, there were
some measurements which we could not make directly with
the chain. For example, we wished to know just how far it
was from our tent to the Jersey shore of the river. We
measured off a base line along our shore 400 feet long and
sighted to a point directly across the river from our tent.
The angle in front of our tent was 90 degrees, and at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
other end of the base line was 73 degrees. When we drew
out our triangle on the scale of 100 feet to the inch we found
that the shorter side directly in front of the tent was almost
exactly 13 inches long. This meant that the river at this
point was 1,300 feet wide, nearly a quarter of a mile. On
the other side of the island we found, in the same way, that
the river at its narrowest point was about 500 feet wide.
This portion of the river we named Lake Placid, as the water
was very still and quite deep. This was due to a sort of
natural dam formed at the lower end of our island. The
small island that Dutchy found was kite-shaped, with a tail
of boulders which extended almost all the way across to a
rocky point on the Pennsylvania shore. The channel between
&#8220;Kite Island,&#8221; as we called it, and Willow Clump
Island was not more than fifteen feet wide in some places,
and through this the water swept with a swift current down
past a narrow neck of land to join the main current. This
narrow stretch of land we named the Tiger&#8217;s Tail, owing to
its peculiar shape. It was in the hook at the end of this tail
that we discovered the old bridge wreck above referred to.
From the tip of the Tiger&#8217;s Tail to Point Lookout, at the extreme
upper end of Willow Clump Island, it was a little under
a half-mile. The shore all along Lake Placid was very
steep, except near Point Lookout. At one place there was
a shallow bay which we called the lagoon.</p>

Fig. 85. The Diving Tree.
</p>
</div>

<p>Lake Placid was a favorite swimming place for us. We
used to plunge in from the branches of a tree which overhung
the water a little ways above the lagoon and made a
natural springboard. We could all swim like ducks, except
Dutchy, who couldn&#8217;t do anything but paddle. However,
Uncle Ed was an expert, and he took Dutchy in hand and
soon made a pretty good swimmer out of him. He also
taught us some fancy strokes. Of course I took no record
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
of these lessons. You would hardly expect me to sit on the
bank with a book in hand jotting down notes while the rest
were splashing around in the cool water having the best of
fun in the world, and even if I had, I wouldn&#8217;t republish the
notes here, because whoever heard of a boy learning to swim
while reading a book on the subject? A beginner had better
leave books alone and plunge right into the water. He will
soon learn to keep himself afloat and can then practise any
fancy strokes that he sees others try. Then, again, don&#8217;t try
to learn in shallow water, because you will never do it. Of
course it doesn&#8217;t pay to jump into water that is over your
head unless there is a good swimmer near by to help you out.
But you will never learn to swim until you have become
accustomed to putting your head under water. You can
not swim with a dry face. The first time we went swimming,
we couldn&#8217;t persuade Dutchy to try it. The water was deep
right up to the very bank and he had never been in over his
head. Instead he sat up in the diving tree swinging his
feet and trying to hide the fact that he was having a dull
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, we&#8217;ve got to douse that fellow,&#8221; said Reddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right; he needs a wash,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
sneak up behind him and chuck him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>They landed a little ways up the stream behind a large
bush and then crept down stealthily on their victim. But
Dutchy had his suspicions aroused and saw them coming.
He scrambled out of the tree in a jiffy and tore off into the
woods as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>We didn&#8217;t expect to see him again that afternoon, for the
pace he was leading should have carried him miles in no time;
but while he couldn&#8217;t swim, Dutchy had his own ideas of fun
on the water. It was about twenty minutes later that we
saw him coming down-stream lying full length on one of
the 2-inch planks taken from the bridge wreck. He was
paddling himself along with arms and legs hung over the
sides of the plank. We all gave him a cheer, and then
started out to have some fun with him. We tried to pull
him off his raft, but he stuck on like a leech. It was only
when we made his craft turn turtle that Dutchy got his head
under water. But it wasn&#8217;t a moment before he scrambled
back on top again, gasping and sputtering to get the water
out of his nose and mouth.</p>

<p>Uncle Ed all this time had been sunning himself on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
bank, when suddenly he uttered a shout of warning. We
were right at the mouth of the mill-race. For the moment
we forgot about Dutchy, and swam out for shore. Before
we realized it Dutchy was caught in the current, and was
being swept full tilt down the stream. My but wasn&#8217;t he
scared. I can see him yet clinging for dear life to the plank,
his face the color of ashes and his eyes bulging out in terror.
First he tried to make for the bank, but the water was so
swift that when the front end of the board struck land the
rear end swung around in a circle, carrying him on again,
but backward this time, before we could reach him. Two
or three more times the plank struck the bank and turned
him around, while we raced along the high bank, scrambling
down to catch him every time he headed for shore, but each
time just missing him. Then he swung out past the Tiger&#8217;s
Tail into the open river just above the rapids. Fortunately
he was going along headforemost this time, and Uncle Ed,
who had just arrived, panting and breathless, from running,
shouted to him to keep his head and steer for a narrow
opening between two jutting boulders. I don&#8217;t know
whether Dutchy did any steering or not, but the raft shot
straight through the opening, and was lost in a cloud of
spray. In a moment he reappeared below the rapids,
paddling like mad for a neck of land on the Pennsylvania
side of the river.</p>

<p>Dutchy would never own up that he was afraid. He
never told a lie under other circumstances, but when it came
to a question of courage he had the habit of stretching facts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
to the very limit. Even in this case, he said that he started
out with the idea of shooting the rapids, and if we hadn&#8217;t
flustered him so, he would not have bumped into the bank
and turned about so many times. Dutchy was a very
glib talker. He nearly persuaded us that it was all done
intentionally, and his thrilling account of the wild dash
between the rocks and through the shower of spray stirred
us up so that we all had to try the trick too.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Shooting the Rapids.</p>

<p>The next day, while Uncle Ed was taking a nap, we stole
off to the upper end of Lake Placid, each one towing a plank.
We needn&#8217;t have been so afraid of Uncle Ed, for we found
out later that he intended to try a plank ride through the
rapids himself next time he went in swimming. Down Lake
Placid we paddled in single column to the mill-race. In a
moment the current had caught us and we were off. I shall
never forget the thrilling ride down the swirling mill-race,
the sudden pause as we shot out into the open river, the
plunge between the boulders and the dive through the spray.
It was all over too soon. Something like coasting&#8211;whiz,
whiz-z-z, and a half-mile walk. Were it not for the trouble
of hauling the planks back by the roundabout course along
the Pennsy shore we would have thought shooting the rapids
a capital game.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Restoring the Drowned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>It was on the second day after Dutchy&#8217;s exploit of the
rapids that Bill came so near drowning. He probably
would have drowned if Uncle Ed hadn&#8217;t been on hand to
work over him. Bill was a fine swimmer, but even the best
of swimmers will sometimes get a cramp, so it is never safe
for any one to go into the water without some one at hand
to help him out in case of accident. In the present case Bill
was doing some fancy strokes by himself over near the
Pennsy shore, while the rest of us were watching Uncle Ed
give Dutchy a lesson in swimming. All of a sudden Bill
threw up his hands and sank. I happened to glance up as
he did it. We thought he was fooling at first, but soon made
out that he was in genuine trouble. Uncle Ed dropped
Dutchy to my tender care, and raced over with a powerful
stroke to the spot where he had last seen his nephew. He
failed to find him on the first dive, but the second time was
successful and he carried the lifeless body to the Pennsylvania

shore. In the meantime I had
landed Dutchy and with the rest
of the boys had crossed the lake.
Uncle Ed first laid Bill on
his back and hastily wiped
dry the mouth and nostrils.
Then he pried his jaws
apart, holding them open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
with a piece of wood wedged in between the teeth. After
which he turned him on his face over a log which was placed
under his stomach. By stomach I do not mean the bowels,
but the real stomach, which lies just under the ribs in front.
Then he pressed with a good weight on the back directly
over the log for nearly a minute, causing the water to flow
out of the mouth. Dutchy had by this time rowed across in
the scow, in which fortunately there happened to be some of
Uncle Ed&#8217;s clothing. This he took and rolled into a bundle,

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
then Bill was laid on his back over the roll of clothing,
which was arranged to raise the pit of his stomach above the
rest of his body. Uncle Ed now wrapped a handkerchief
around his forefinger, and with it wiped out Bill&#8217;s mouth
and throat. Reddy, who was the least excited of the lot,
was told to draw Bill&#8217;s tongue forward so as to prevent it
from falling back and choking the windpipe. This he did
with the dry part of the handkerchief, drawing the end of the
tongue out at the corner of the mouth, and holding it there
while Uncle Ed and I started the pumping action, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
produced artificial respiration. I was directed to grasp Bill&#8217;s
arms just below the elbows, and swing them vertically in
an arc until the hands met the ground again above the head.
This expanded the chest. Uncle Ed at the same time stood

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 89. Squeezing out the Air from the Lungs.
</span>
</span>
over the body with his elbows on his knees and hands extended,
as illustrated in Fig. 88. Then I swung the arms
up and back to the sides of the body, but just before the
hands touched the ground Uncle Ed seized the body in both
hands just below the ribs, and as soon as I touched the arms
to the ground he
swung forward with
all his weight on his
hands, squeezing
the waist
and pushing
upward so as
to force out
the air in the chest. Then he slowly counted, one, two,
three, four, all the time steadily increasing the pressure,
until at the signal four, with a final push, he shoved himself
to the first position, shown in Fig. 88. At the same
signal I drew the arms up again over the head, and held
them there while Uncle Ed again counted four; then I returned
the arms to the sides, and Uncle Ed repeated the
squeezing process. These movements were continued for
about three minutes, and then Bill gave a short, faint gasp.
We kept on with the artificial respiration, assisting the gasps,
which gradually grew stronger, until they had deepened into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
steady breathing. Then we stripped off the wet bathing suit,
and wrapping Bill in Uncle Ed&#8217;s clothing, laid him in the
bottom of the boat. While Dutchy hurried the boat across,
Uncle Ed rubbed the patient&#8217;s arms and legs. The rest of
us swam over and ran for blankets from the tent. Bill was
wrapped in one of the blankets and the other was used as a
stretcher, on which we carried him to the tent. Then one of
us was sent post-haste across to Lumberville for some
whiskey, which was diluted in hot water and given the patient
a teaspoonful at a dose, every fifteen minutes at first, and then
at less frequent intervals. Uncle Ed kept Bill in bed all
the next day for fear of congestion of the lungs. He told
us that unless the patient kept perfectly quiet for a couple
of days, he was liable to be seized with a sudden attack of
hard breathing that might choke him to death in a short
time. To stop such an attack he told us that the best plan
was to apply a mustard plaster to the chest, and if the patient
commenced to gasp, to start pumping the arms and squeezing
the waist so as to help him breathe. After Bill had come
around and was himself again Uncle Ed gave us a thorough
drill in methods of restoring the drowned. He laid down on
the grass and made us practise on him the various directions
which he gave us.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>How to Work Over a Patient Alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you boys hadn&#8217;t been so excited,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I would
have made you rub Bill&#8217;s body and limbs while we were
pumping the air into him, but I knew you would get in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
way, and be more of a bother than a help. You must learn
to be calm in any accident; excitement doesn&#8217;t pay. Keep
steadily and slowly at your pumping, for you might have to
do it for four hours before the patient comes to.&#8221; He taught
us just how to swing the arms and squeeze the ribs to best advantage,
and how to hold the tongue without getting in the
way of the arms as they were pumped back and forth. There
was also a special way of rubbing the arms and legs. The

</span>
</span>
limbs were always rubbed upward,
or toward the body, with the bare
hands, or a dry cloth if there was
one at hand,
but this all had
to be done
without interfering
with the
pumping action.
&#8220;If the patient doesn&#8217;t come around in five minutes,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;turn him on his face again over the roll of clothing,
or any other suitable substitute, and press out the water from
the stomach, rolling him first to one side and then to the
other; be sure to get all the water out.&#8221; When we had
learned our lesson well, Uncle Ed took Dutchy for his
patient, and proceeded to show us how a man could work
over him alone. First he went through the operation of
squeezing the water out of him, and drying his nose and
mouth, much to the patient&#8217;s discomfort; then he drew
Dutchy&#8217;s tongue out of the corner of his mouth, holding it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
there by closing the jaws on it, and holding the jaws together
by passing a handkerchief over his chin and lapping it over
his head. After that he began to pump, seizing the patient&#8217;s
arms and swinging them up over the head and back, as before.
Just as the arms were dropped back to the sides of
the body, he squeezed them in against the ribs, at the same
time drawing upward toward the head and counting four
each time, as he had done before. But the lesson was
abruptly interrupted by Dutchy, whose imagination was
worked up to such a pitch that I actually believe he thought
he had been drowning. Anyway, he squirmed out of Uncle
Ed&#8217;s grasp, and wouldn&#8217;t play patient any longer. For
several days after that we couldn&#8217;t persuade him to venture
near deep water.</p>

<p>Willow Clump Island was, for the most part, a trackless
wilderness, and as soon as we had made our map we laid
out roads to the different important points. Our main highway
ran from Point Lookout to Tiger&#8217;s Tail. This road
was made rather winding, to add to its picturesqueness, and

</p>
</div>

<p>We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
ran a bridge across the mill-race at its narrowest point.
This bridge was made of trees which we had cut down in
making our road. It was quite a piece of engineering, built
under Uncle Ed&#8217;s guidance. Two frames were made of the
shape shown in Figs. 91 and 92. The side sticks were
15 feet long and spaced about 10 feet apart at the base by
crosspieces. At the upper end one frame was made 6 feet
wide and the other 5 feet wide. The side and cross spars
were mortised together and secured by lashing a rope around
them. To make the frames more rigid we braced them with
diagonal braces nailed on. When completed we set the
frames up on opposite sides of the stream and with ropes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
carefully lowered their upper ends until they interlocked, the
side spars of each frame resting on the cross spars of the
other. In the angles formed by the crossing side spars
a center spar was laid, and a number of floor beams or spars
were stretched to this from the opposite shores. On these a
flooring was spread made of saplings, cut and trimmed to
the right size. A rustic railing on each side of the bridge
completed the structure.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>The mill-race was crossed further
down by a rope line on which we rigged
a traveling carriage. A light manila
rope was used, anchored to a tree
at each side about fifteen feet from
the ground. A pulley block
with a wheel or sheave 4 inches
in diameter was mounted to
travel on the rope. Suspended
from this block by means of fall
and tackle was a swing seat. This,
as shown in Fig. 94, was merely a

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
board fastened with four rope strands
to the ring of the tackle block. A
single rope was used, with the ends
tied firmly together. The loop thus
formed was passed through the ring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
of the tackle block and the opposite ends were twisted over
the ends of the seat board in the manner illustrated in Fig.
95. The tackle blocks were quite small, having 2-inch
sheaves, and they, together with the large pulley or &#8220;traveling
block,&#8221; as we called it, cost us about $2.50. Two light
ropes were fastened to the large traveling block, each rope
long enough to reach across the stream. The ropes extended
to opposite anchorages, where each was passed over
a branch of the tree and belayed on a cleat within easy reach.
A fellow could draw himself up clear of the ground by pulling
on the free end of the fall, as a painter does; then tying
the swing fast in this position, he would pull himself across
the stream by means of the rope stretched to the opposite
anchorage. The swing could be drawn back by the next
one who wanted to cross. We also used this aerial line for
transporting loads from one island to the other.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Our aerial railway didn&#8217;t last
long. We soon tired of it, and
instead utilized the materials for
a rope suspension bridge. We procured from Lumberville
half a dozen old barrels and used the staves as a flooring for
the bridge. The staves were linked together by a pair of
ropes at each end woven over and under, as indicated in the
drawing Fig. 97. Notches were cut in the staves to hold

the ropes from slipping off. The flexible flooring thus constructed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
was stretched across the river and secured to stakes
driven firmly in the ground. A pair of parallel ropes were
extended across the stream about three feet above the flooring,
with which they were connected at intervals of five feet.
The bridge was 25 feet long,
and while rather shaky, owing
to the fact that there were
no braces to prevent it from
swaying sidewise, still it
was very strong and did excellent
service.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Pontoon Bridge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>At the head of the mill-race, where the channel was fifty
feet wide, we built a pontoon bridge. We were fortunate
in securing six good cider barrels at low cost, also a quantity
of &#8220;slabs&#8221; from one of the sawmills of Lumberville.
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i103'></a><img src='images/fig-099.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 99. The Pontoon Bridge.
</span>
</span>
&#8220;Slab&#8221; is the lumberman&#8217;s name for the outside piece of a
log which is sawn off in squaring up the sides. We made a
raft of these materials and floated them down the river to
Lake Placid. The bridge was made by anchoring the barrels
in the channel about eight feet apart, and laying on them the
floor beams, which supported a flooring of slabs. The floor
beams were narrow planks 1 inch by 4 inches, taken from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
the bridge wreck, and they were placed on edge to prevent
sagging. Of course we had no anchors for securing the
barrels, but used instead large stones weighing about 100
pounds each, around which the anchor lines were fastened.
We found it rather difficult to sink these improvised anchors
at just the right places, for we were working at the very
mouth of the mill-race, and were in constant danger of having
our scow sucked down into the swirling channel. Once we
were actually drawn into the mill-race and tore madly down
the rushing stream. By Bill&#8217;s careful steering we managed
to avoid striking the shore, and just as we were off the
Tiger&#8217;s Tail Reddy succeeded in swinging a rope around an
overhanging limb and bringing us to a sudden stop. A
moment later we might have been dashed against the rocks
in the rapids below and our boat smashed. Shooting rapids
in a scow is a very different matter from riding through them
on a plank.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The King Rod Truss.</p>

<p>Our bridge building operations were not entirely confined
to the island. Two of them were built on the Schreiner
grounds at Lamington. Reddy Schreiner&#8217;s home was situated
a little distance above the town where Cedar Brook
came tumbling down a gorge in the hills and spread out into
the Schreiners&#8217; ice pond. Thence it pursued its course very
quietly through the low and somewhat swampy ground in
the Schreiners&#8217; back yard. Over this brook Reddy was very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
anxious to build a bridge. Accordingly, before returning to
school in the fall Bill made out a careful set of plans for
the structure, and after we had gone the rest of the society,
under Reddy&#8217;s guidance, erected the bridge.</p>

<p>The structure was a cross between a suspension bridge and
a spar bridge. The banks of the stream were so low that,
instead of resting the floor of the bridge on top of the inclined
frames, as we had done over the mill-race, it was
suspended from the spars by means of wires. The crossing
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i104'></a><img src='images/fig-100.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 100. The King Rod Bridge.
</span>
</span>
ends of the spars were nailed together and their lower ends
were firmly planted about four feet apart in the banks of the
brook. A stick nailed to the apex of each pair of spars
served temporarily to brace them apart. The center cross
beam of the bridge was now suspended from the spars by
means of heavy galvanized iron wire (No. 14, I should say).
The beam was hung high enough to allow for stretch of the
wire, making the roadway incline upward from both sides
to the center. Aside from carrying the floor of the bridge,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
this beam was used to brace the inclined spars when the
temporary crosspiece was removed. The ends of the beam
projected about thirty inches beyond the bridge at each
side, and they supported braces which extended diagonally
upward to the crossing ends of the spars. When this was
done the temporary crosspiece above referred to was removed.
As the span between the center cross beam and the
banks was a little too long to provide a steady floor, a couple
of intermediate cross beams were suspended from the inclined
spars. The floor beams were then laid in place and
covered with a flooring of slabs.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Stiffening the Bridge.</p>

<p>The bridge was a pretty good one, except for a slight unsteadiness
between the center and either end. When Uncle
Ed saw it he showed us at once where the trouble lay. Our
intermediate cross beams were hung from the center of the
spars, and consequently made them bend, because the strain
came across their length, while at the center of the bridge
there was no chance for the spars to bend, because the strain
was exerted along their length, that is, it tended merely to
push the ends of the spars deeper into the banks. To remedy
the trouble he proposed propping up the center of each spar
with a brace running from the center crosspiece. The dotted
lines in Fig. 100 show how these braces were applied. They
made the floor perfectly solid throughout, and gave the
bridge a much better appearance. Uncle Ed told us that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
structure might be called a &#8220;king rod truss,&#8221; except that
in place of rods we had used wires.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The King Post Bridge.</p>

<p>The other bridge on the Schreiner property was built in
the following summer, just before we started on our second
expedition to Willow Clump Island. It spanned the brook
at the gorge, and was therefore a more difficult engineering
feat. Mr. Schreiner himself asked us to build it, and we
felt greatly honored by the request. A search was made in
the Van Syckel library for a suitable type. At last we found
one that seemed properly suited to the requirements. It was
called a &#8220;king post truss,&#8221; and was very similar to the king
rod bridge. While the design of the bridge was simple, yet
it required some ingenuity to put it together. In setting up
the other bridge the scow had been anchored in the center
of the stream and used as a working platform, from which it
had been an easy matter to put the various parts together.
In this case our scow was obviously of no use, so we laid a
couple of long logs across the chasm, and a few slats were
nailed across them to provide a temporary bridge or working
platform. The platform sagged considerably at the center,
because the span was fully eighteen feet; but the logs were
large, and we knew they were strong enough to support our
weight. However, as an extra precaution, we tied the ends
to stakes driven in the ground, so that they could not possibly
slip off the banks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>First we set about constructing the king posts, which were
made as shown in Fig. 101. Two stout posts 7 feet long
were connected at the top by a tie stick, which spaced them
4 feet apart. To make a secure fastening they were notched
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i107'></a><img src='images/fig-101.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
together and strengthened with diagonal braces. Each king
post was notched on opposite sides, at about thirty inches
from the top. A temporary
tie piece was also nailed
across the lower ends of the
king posts. The frame
thus formed was set up at
the center of the span and
temporarily held by nailing
the lower tie piece to the
working platform. Four
stout spars were now cut,
each about fifteen feet long.
Taking a pair at a time, we
planted their lower ends
firmly in the opposite banks
and sawed off their upper
<span class='image-right'>

</span>
</span>
ends until they could just be hammered into the notches in
the king post. This required careful fitting, but by making
the spars a little too long to start with, and then shaving
them down with a draw-knife, we managed to make fairly
good joints. A couple of long wire nails in each spar made
the structure perfectly secure. The king posts were now
sawed off just above the temporary tie piece, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
permanent cross beam was fastened to these ends with straps
of heavy wire wound tightly about them. The working platform
sagged so much that we were able to lay this cross
beam above it. From the ends of the cross beam diagonal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
braces extended to the king posts (Fig. 103). Our working

</span>
platform was now removed and replaced with the permanent
floor beams, which were firmly nailed to the center cross
beam and to the inclined spars at the shore ends. The floor
beams were quite heavy and needed no support between the
king posts and shore. A rustic floor was made of small logs
sawed in two at Mr. Schreiner&#8217;s sawmill. Light poles were
nailed to the flooring along each edge, giving a finish to the
bridge. We also provided a rustic railing for the bridge of
light poles nailed to the king posts and the diagonal spars.</p>

<p>Like all inhabitants of islands, we early turned our attention
to navigation. Our scow was serviceable for transporting
materials back and forth across the strips of shallow
water between our quarters and the Jersey shore. We never
attempted to row across, because progress would have been
entirely too slow, and we would have drifted down to the
rapids long ere we could reach the opposite side. But on Lake
Placid matters were different. Although there was no settlement
near us on the Pennsylvania shore, to occasion our
crossing the water for provisions and the like, yet the quiet
stretch was admirably suited to boating for pleasure, and
mighty little pleasure could we get out of our heavy scow.</p>

<p>Owing to a sudden business call Uncle Ed left us after he

explained carefully to Bill just how to construct a canvas
canoe. Jack, the cook, who was anxious to lay in a second
supply of provisions, accompanied Uncle Ed as far as Millville,
the next town below Lamington. Here Uncle Ed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
bought five yards of canvas, 42 inches wide, several cans of
paint and a quantity of brass and copper nails and tacks.
These supplies, together with the food provisions that Jack
had collected, were brought to us late in the afternoon by
Mr. Schreiner. Mr. Schreiner also brought the necessary
boards and strips of wood for the framework of our canoe.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Visit from Mr. Schreiner.</p>

<p>We invited Mr. Schreiner to spend the night with us, and
this he did after fording with some difficulty the swift-running
river. In the morning we showed him our quarters, our
filter, the roads we had built, the spar bridge across to Kite
Island, our surveying instrument and the chart we had made
of the vicinity. He was greatly pleased with our work, and
it was then that he gave us an order for the bridge over the
gorge. From that day on he became our staunchest ally, so
that when my father and Mr. Van Syckel complained that
we were loafing away a lot of time which could be more
profitably spent in study or work, Mr. Schreiner stood up
for us and declared that our experiences on the island were
doing us far more good, both physically and mentally, than
any other work that they could conceive of; that before condemning
us they should pay us a visit and see how we were
employing our time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>Immediately after Mr. Schreiner&#8217;s departure we started
work on the canoe. A strip of spruce 1 inch thick, 3 inches
wide and 12 feet long served as the keelson. At the stern a
post 1-1/2 inches thick, 3 inches wide and 13 inches high was
secured to the keelson
with brass
screws. This was
braced as indicated
in Fig. 104. At the
bow a stem piece
was attached to the
keelson. This stem was cut to a somewhat semicircular form,
as shown in Fig. 105. The outer edge was tapered with a

draw-knife to a thickness of 1/4 inch and a brace was nailed
to the inner edge. Our next work was to cut out three
forms, one of the shape shown in Fig. 106 and two like
that shown in Fig. 107. The first form was set up on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
keelson midway between the stem and stern, and the other
two were spaced about four feet each side of the center
form. The center form was used only for shaping the

frame of the boat, and was not intended to be permanently
affixed to the canoe. Therefore, we fastened it to the keelson
very lightly, so that it could be readily removed. The other
two forms, however, were made permanent parts of the
frame, serving as bulkheads. The gunwales were now secured

in position. These were of spruce 3/4 inch thick and 2
inches wide. The ends were beveled off so as to neatly fit the
stem piece and the stern post, to which they were fastened
by brass screws. Then we applied the longitudinal strips, or
rib bands, which were of 1/4-inch thick spruce 1 inch wide.
Ten of these bands were used, equally spaced apart on the

nailed securely to the bulkheads and the stem piece and stern
post. The cross ribs were made of barrel hoops which we
had soaked in water for a day or so to render them pliable

enough to be bent into place. These hoops were split to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
width of 1/2 inch, and secured
first to the keelson, then to the
longitudinal strips and finally to
the gunwales. Copper tacks

were used for nailing the ribs in
place, and these were long enough to be passed through the
rib bands and clinched on the outside. Forty cross ribs were
nailed on, and at the
center of the canoe
they were spaced about
three inches apart. The
center form was then
removed and cut along
the dotted lines shown
in Fig. 106. The
semicircular pieces
thus obtained were
now strengthened with
strips on their inner
edges, and wedged in
between the keelson
and the gunwales, to
which they were
nailed, as shown in
Fig. 108. A pair of
cleats nailed to the
cross ribs served as
supports for the seat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
of the canoe. The frame of the boat was completed by
nailing in place two deck beams of 1/2-inch square pine and
four corner pieces between the gunwales and the bulkheads,
so as to make an elliptical well hole or deck opening. Before
laying on the canvas covering the edges of the gunwales,
keelson, deck beams, stem and stern posts were smoothed
down with sandpaper.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Stretching on the Canvas.</p>

<p>The frame was laid in the center of the canvas and the
latter drawn around it. Then with a large needle and strong
twine we sewed both edges of the cloth together with long
stitches, lacing the canvas over the frame as a shoe is laced
over a foot. This done, the boat was turned deck downward
and the canvas was tacked to the keelson. In each case,

before driving in a tack a daub of white lead was applied, to
water-proof the spot. At the stem and stern a gore (narrow
triangular piece) was cut out of the canvas so as to make it
lie smooth on the frame, and white lead was painted in between
the overlapping edges. The canoe was then turned
deck upward and the lacing tightened, while we carefully
worked out all wrinkles in the cloth. After tacking the
canvas along the gunwales on the outside, it was trimmed off,
leaving sufficient margin to be brought over the gunwales
and tacked inside. Two triangular pieces were cut out for
the decks, and these were lapped over the outer canvas and
tacked to the gunwales. A narrow molding along the edge
of the boat served to cover the tack heads and added a certain
finish to the canoe. A keel plate 2 inches wide and 1
inch thick was attached to the outside of the boat, and then,
after wetting the canvas, it was given a coat of white lead
and oil. When this was perfectly dry it was sandpapered
and the second coat applied.</p>

to about 1 inch diameter at the

and over we went. We were very poor sailors at first, but

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Lee Boards.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>One thing that bothered us greatly in sailing was the keel
of our canoe. It was forever getting twisted, particularly
when we tried to make a landing. There were only a few
places along the island where the water was deep enough to
permit our coming right up to shore without striking the
keel. The fastening was not very strong, and every once and
awhile it would be wrenched loose. The matter was made
the subject of a special letter to Uncle Ed, and in due time
his answer was received. As usual, he offered a first-class
solution of the difficulty. &#8220;Don&#8217;t use a keel,&#8221; he wrote;
&#8220;lee boards are much better.&#8221; Then he went on to explain
what was meant by lee boards: &#8220;The leeward side of a
boat is the opposite of the windward side; that is, that side
of the boat which is sheltered from the wind. Lee boards,
then, are boards which are hung over the lee side of a boat
to prevent it from drifting to leeward,
and they serve to take the
place of a keel or centerboard.&#8221;</p>

<p class='center caption'>
Fig. 121. A Lee Board.
</p>

<p>Following Uncle Ed&#8217;s direction
we fastened a strip of wood across
the canoe about six feet from the
bow, nailing it firmly to the gunwales.
This provided a support to
which the lee boards were secured.
The lee boards were paddle-shaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
affairs of the form and dimensions shown in Fig. 121. Each
paddle near the top was hinged to the end of a board three
inches wide and a foot long. The paddle was held at right
angles to the board by means of a
hook. Each board was fastened

</span>
with door hinges to a baseboard
which extended the width of the boat
and was attached to the crosspiece
of the canoe by means of a couple of
bolts. The bolt heads were countersunk,
so that the hinged boards could
lie flat over them. To the top of each lee board two ropes
were attached, one passing forward around a pulley and
thence back to a cleat within easy reach of the occupant of

By pulling the former rope the lee board was lifted out of
the water, while the latter rope was used to swing the board
into working position. When tacking to port (left), the
board on the left side of the canoe was lowered and the
other was raised, as shown in Fig. 123, and when tacking to

gunwales. The keelson was formed of 1-inch spruce 3
inches wide and 10 feet long. The stem and stern, which
were both of the same shape, were cut from a
12-inch board to the form shown in Fig. 126,
and were firmly secured to the keelson.
This made the boat 12 feet
long. The forms were then
set in place on the keelson,
one at the center and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
others three feet each side. The gunwales were formed
of 3/4-inch by 2-1/2-inch spruce, and the twelve rib bands used
were of the size used in our first boat. As none of these
forms was to remain in the boat, nails were driven very

lightly into them, with heads projecting so that they could
easily be withdrawn when it was time to remove the forms.
The cross ribs were passed under the keelson inside of the
rib bands and outside of the gunwales, as shown in Fig. 128.
After they were set in place and firmly secured with copper
tacks, a band was nailed to the keelson to form the keel.
To produce the raised stem and stern, four
wedge-shaped pieces were nailed to
the tops of the gunwales, as
indicated in Fig. 129. The

forms were then removed
and were replaced with
cross sticks braced between
the gunwales. The center
cross stick was provided
with two corner pieces, as
shown in Fig. 130, adapted to fit under the gunwales and
against the rib bands. The canvas was then applied in the
manner described before, but was tacked to the upper edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
of the gunwale instead of the outer side, and the tacks were
covered by a half-round molding which extended around the
entire boat. After the lacing was cut the edge of the canvas
was secured to the
under edges of
the gunwales.
The canoe was
then completed
by fastening on a
1-inch square keel
and treating the
boat with two coats of paint. The paddle was a duplicate of
the one described in connection with the sailing canoe.</p>

<p>One afternoon Fred, who had waded over to Lumberville
after some provisions, came splashing back holding aloft
a large square envelope. It was from Uncle Ed and contained
a photograph of a group of Wichita Indians building
a large grass lodge. In a brief explanatory letter Uncle Ed
suggested that we build a similar hut on our Island.</p>

<p class='center caption'>

</p>
</div>

<p>The grass lodge appealed
to us as very
picturesque, and we
set to work immediately
on its construction.
We made our
hut much smaller,
however, only 12
feet in diameter,
and 8 or 9 feet
high. First we procured
two dozen
light poles between
10 and 12 feet long.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
These we set up about 18 inches apart in a circle like a stockade,
the sticks being buried in the ground to a depth of 12
inches. At one side a space of 3 feet was allowed for a
doorway. Inside the stockade we erected a working platform
of planks supported on barrels, and standing on this
we took two opposite poles, bent them inward and lashed
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i140'></a><img src='images/fig-132.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 132. Doorway of the Hut.
</span>
</span>
their upper ends together. Then a second
pair of opposite poles were similarly
bent inward and tied, and so we
proceeded until the entire stockade
had been converted into
a dome-shaped cage. Around
these poles we laid lighter
sticks, or bands, tying them
at the points of intersection.
At the doorway two posts
were set firmly in the ground,
projecting upward to a height
of 4 feet. A lintel nailed across the top of the posts completed
the door frame. Sticks were nailed to the lintel and
to the side posts, extending to the main frame of the hut, to
which they were tied. We were now ready to thatch our
hut. Reddy and Dutchy went over to Lumberville for
several bales of straw. We tied the straw in bunches and
applied it to the frame, copying, as best we could, the
process illustrated in the photograph.</p>

<p>But for its location the hut would have proved a very
serviceable habitation. In order to have a good, dry dwelling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
without laying down a board flooring, we had selected
for its site the sandy shore at Point Lookout. This part of
the island was not sheltered with trees, and the hot sun beat
down on our hut so strongly that we found the quarters
very uncomfortable indeed. It was this fact that led to
the construction of a tree hut&#8211;a building that would be
perfectly dry and yet shaded and cool. Bill had read of
such houses in the Philippines and felt confident that we
could build one. We couldn&#8217;t decide at first where to locate
our hut until Dutchy moved that we build it in the gnarled
oak tree overlooking the &#8220;Goblins&#8217; Dancing Platform.&#8221;
Immediately the motion was seconded and unanimously
carried.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Goblins&#8217; Dancing Platform.</p>

<p>Just above the town of Lumberville there was a cliff
which rose sheer 200 feet above the level of the river. So
perpendicular was the cliff that a stone dropped from the
overhanging ledge at the top would fall straight down to
the railroad track below without touching a twig in its
course. Back of this broad ledge there was a very peculiar
formation. A column of stone rose abruptly 40 feet higher
and was topped with a large slab about 12 feet in diameter.
This was known all over that region as the Goblins&#8217; Dancing
Platform. The only possible way of gaining the summit
of the column was by climbing a scraggly oak tree which
grew on the high ground back of the pillar, crawling out on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
an overhanging limb, and then dropping down to the platform
below. It was in this oak that we decided to build our
house. It was a very inaccessible spot, and to reach it we
had to make a wide detour around the back of the hill, and
through the fields of a cranky farmer, who more than once
threatened to fill us with bird shot for trespassing on his
property. How were we to carry all our building materials
up to this great height? One would think that the difficulties
would be enough to discourage us, but not so with the
S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I. Nothing daunted us.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Dutchy Takes a Dare.</p>

<p>Our first task was to try some other approach to the top of
the cliff. At one side of the overhanging ledge there was
a fissure in the rocks which ran from the base of the pillar
to the foot of the cliff. Down this zigzag crevice Dutchy
had scrambled, one afternoon, on a dare. We were rather
frightened when he started, because it was a very hazardous
undertaking, and we watched him anxiously, peering over the
edge of the precipice. By bracing his back against one of
the walls of the rock, and digging his feet into the niches and
chinks of the opposite wall, he safely made his way to a
shelf about half-way down, where he paused to rest. From
that point on the fissure widened out, and a steep, almost
vertical incline, sparsely covered with vegetation, led to the
railroad track below. I think he must have become rather
frightened at his position, because he hesitated long before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
he resumed his downward course, and when he finally did
make the attempt his foot slipped upon the moss-covered
rocks and down he fell, scratching and clawing at every shrub
within reach. Believing him to be killed, we rushed down
the hill and around to the foot of the cliff. It probably
took us about fifteen or twenty minutes, though it seemed
ages before we came upon our venturesome comrade coolly
trying to pin together a rent of inconvenient location and
dimensions in his trousers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Dutchy, are you killed?&#8221; cried Bill, breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed, nothing,&#8221; he replied, with scorn. &#8220;I suppose
you fellows think I had a fall. Well, I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t, eh? We saw you slip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go on. I came down that way on purpose. There
was no use in picking my way down like a &#8217;fraid cat, when I
could just as well take a smooth and easy toboggan slide
on the bushes all the way down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smooth and easy toboggan slide! Well, you should have
seen the hillside. The course was well defined by the torn
and uprooted shrubs and the pile of branches and vines at
Dutchy&#8217;s feet. Whether the hare-brained Dutchy really
imagined he could glide easily down on the shrubbery, his
frantic movements on the way certainly belied his story,
and when, the next day, we proposed that he repeat the trick,
somehow he didn&#8217;t seem to be very enthusiastic on the
subject.</p>

depressions were
formed we wedged in
sticks of wood between

no such niches appeared for
considerable height, we
would stretch a rope ladder to
the next fixed rung. In most
places the natural formation

afford sufficient footing.</p>

<p>After providing a means for
scaling the cliff (we called it the
Jacob&#8217;s Ladder), we were still
confronted with the problem how to cart our building materials
to the top. It was a very hard task and you couldn&#8217;t
have hired us to do it under any other
circumstances. First, Bill planned out on

paper just how the house was to be
built, and we cut all the pieces to the
right size so as not to carry up
any superfluous matter. When
all was ready the boards and
sticks were loaded on the scow,
and ferried over to the cliff.
Then we carried them on our
backs, three or four at a time,
up the slanting hillside to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
first ledge. From there up, owing to the steepness of the
ascent, we had to employ different tactics.</p>

<p>A derrick was
constructed of two
sticks 10 feet long, which were
bolted together at the top, and
secured about five feet apart at
the bottom by a cross piece, as
shown in Fig. 136. The derrick was
then taken apart and with some difficulty
hauled piecemeal up to the next ledge above. Here it
was put together again. The fall and tackle used in our
aerial railway was attached to the apex of the derrick, and
the latter was then erected with the legs set into depressions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
in the ledge and the upper ends slanting outward but kept
from falling over the edge by a rope tied to one of the fixed
rungs set in the fissure. With this derrick we hoisted up
the boards in a few hauls. The job was a very ticklish one,
but Bill used the greatest care to prevent accident. The
derrick, rope and tackle were carefully tested before used,
and as soon as the load was attached to the lower pulley
block the two who did the loading were instructed to crawl
back into the fissure so as to be out of danger in case anything
gave way. At one time a stick which had been carelessly
tied did fall, and it might have badly hurt some one
had we not observed this precaution. When we had raised
the material to the second ledge we transferred operations
to the top ledge, and when the materials had been hauled up
to this point we finally rigged up our fall and tackle in the
old oak tree itself.</p>

</div>

<p>The tree had two large
limbs which extended out at
a wide angle from the main
trunk. Across these two limbs,
at about seven feet out, we laid
our first girder, nailing it securely in place. Then to the
main trunk we nailed the second girder on a level with the
first. Diagonal braces were extended from the trunk to
support the ends of this girder, and a tie piece was nailed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
the braces, as shown in Fig. 138, to prevent them from
spreading. The girders were rough sticks about 4 inches in
diameter and 10 feet long. We cut flat faces on them at
the points where they were nailed to the tree, and then, to
make them doubly secured, we nailed cleats, or blocks of

laid across and nailed to the girders. They were cut to a
length of 10 feet so as to project beyond the outer girder
to provide for a piazza overhanging the Goblins&#8217; Platform.
Six floor beams were used, spaced 20 inches apart. All
branches projecting up between the beams were then cut
away and a flooring of slabs was laid on. To the main
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
trunk six feet above the flooring, a stick or (to use the technical
term), &#8220;wall plate,&#8221; was nailed on, and its ends were
supported by upright posts resting on the platform. Thirty
inches from the outer end of the platform two more posts
were erected eight feet high and secured by sticks nailed
across from the other posts, and also by a second wall plate
connecting their upper ends. Four more posts were erected,
one between each pair of the corner posts, and then we were
ready to enclose the framing.</p>

<p>We had two doors; one at the back
of the house, from
which a ladder extended
down to the ground, and another
opening out onto the veranda, from
which we dropped a ladder down to the
Goblins&#8217; Dancing Platform. In order
to save space we used sliding instead of
swinging doors. The back door frame
was 5-1/2 feet high and the front door
frame 6 feet high. The doors were
mounted on the outside of the building.
The side posts of each frame were 2-1/2
feet apart, and the lintel and sill
extended 3 feet beyond the side
post at one side. The upper face
of the lintel was planed down perfectly
smooth, and its edges were
tapered off to make a track for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
rollers on the door. The rollers consisted of two spools,
which turned on tenpenny nails driven into the top of the
door. At the lower end two more spools were mounted,
turning on nails driven in the bottom edge of the door. The
rims of the spools extended slightly beyond the outer face of
the door and rolled against the sill. To keep the water
from leaking in at the top a slanting board was fastened
above it, as shown in Fig. 144. The back door was similarly
constructed. Our tree house was completed by a running
balustrade around the veranda.</p>

<p>We were a proud lot when the house was finally completed.
From the veranda we had an excellent view up and down
the river. We could see our camp on the island and keep
watch of our goods. Late one afternoon Dutchy and I
were lolling about on the Goblins&#8217; Platform, idly watching
a hawk soaring above us. The rest of the boys had returned
to the island in canoes an hour before and left the heavy
scow for us to row back. It was drawing near supper time
and we had about decided to start for home, when I chanced
to see a scow up the river. It looked exactly like ours, and
in it were two men, evidently drunk, from the way they
carried on. A glance showed me that our scow was not at its
moorings. How were we to reach the camp? One of the
men had evidently seen us and was pointing us out to his
companion. We rushed down the Jacob&#8217;s Ladder, but by
the time we reached the river bank they were in midstream
and heading rapidly northward. Our shouts merely brought
forth derisive laughter. We were certainly in a predicament.
First we ran back up the cliff, and tried from there
to gain the attention of the rest of the fellows. They evidently
saw us but couldn&#8217;t make out what we wanted. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
we ran down to a point opposite the island and called to
them. But the wind was against us and we couldn&#8217;t make
them hear, so we had to plunge in and wade across.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Council of War.</p>

<p>Immediately we summoned a war council. Dutchy and
Jack were chosen by lot to guard the camp, while the rest
of us started in pursuit in canoes. By the time we got under
way the sun had dropped back of the Pennsylvania hills
and the shadows were climbing slowly up the Jacob&#8217;s Ladder.
Swiftly we paddled up-stream, keeping close to the western
shore, where the water was very quiet. We didn&#8217;t expect
to go far, because there were rapids less than three miles
up, and we were sure that no tramps would ever be ambitious
enough to row a heavy scow against the swift current at that
point. As we rounded a sharp bend in the river, we noticed
a camp fire a few hundred feet further up, around which five
or six men were lounging, and there, just below them, was
our scow. What were four boys to do against six grown
men? We were each armed with a club, and could have
made a pretty good fight if necessary, but after a whispered
consultation we decided it would be best to wait until dark,
when we could creep up quietly and steal away unnoticed
with our boat.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Vengeance.</p>

<p>It seemed as if darkness never would come. It was
scarcely dusk when our patience gave out and we paddled up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
stealthily, hugging the shore. Bill gained the scow unnoticed,
but just as he was about to push off he discerned the
body of a man within. It was one of the tramps lying there
in a drunken stupor. What was to be done? Every moment
was precious. A yell from the fireside decided him. With a
mighty push he launched the boat out into the current, while
we threw him a line and towed the boat out to midstream.
With a volley of curses the men sprang up and pelted us with
stones. But they were poor shots, and we escaped without
serious injury. Our prisoner, in the meantime, was snoring
heavily in the scow undisturbed. We took him down-stream
and then unceremoniously picked him up and dumped him
overboard within a few feet of the shore. It was a rude
awakening, and nearly frightened the wits out of the man.
But it brought him to his senses, and in a moment we were
dodging more stones, sent with such good aim that we had
to lie flat in the bottoms of the boats until the current carried
us out of reach.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Double Surprise.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark, and we had some difficulty in
groping our way back to camp. There was no moon and
the stars were obscured by clouds. Our only course was to
follow the shore line until we got around the bend, and then
we steered for the beacon fire, which, by prearrangement,
had been kindled on Point Lookout. But the spirit of
mischief was in us. We thought we would have some fun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
with Dutchy. We could see him silhouetted against the
blaze. Jim and I hung back in the canoes, while Reddy and
Bill went on with the scow, splashing their oars and shouting
and singing in disguised voices, like drunken men. Dutchy
was evidently very much agitated. His &#8220;Hello, there!
Boat ahoy!&#8221; was greeted with derisive yells.</p>

<p>This was too much for Dutchy. He ran for all he was
worth, yelling for Jack to come quick.</p>

<p>We had a merry laugh over the situation when suddenly
the tables were turned. Something whizzed past Bill&#8217;s
ear; I was stung on the arm with a heavy nail; a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
large stone hit the scow; Reddy had his hat knocked off, and
Fred upset his canoe trying to duck out of reach of the invisible
missiles before we could make our assailants understand
that we were friends and not the tramps. The joke
was on us after all. We hadn&#8217;t counted on Dutchy&#8217;s accurate
aim or Jack&#8217;s skill with the crossbow.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Around the camp fire that night we discussed our adventures
and made plans to prevent their recurrence. It was
evident, for one thing, that we would have to moor our
boats off shore in such a way that they would be out of reach
of meddlesome persons,
and yet could be drawn
in toward shore by any one who knew how. This was the way
we did it. A pair of galvanized iron ring bolts were procured
on Jack&#8217;s next trip to Lamington for provisions, also a
light rope about forty feet long. The ring bolts were screwed
into a pair of stout anchor stakes about two feet from their
lower ends. The rope was passed through the rings and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
ends were joined by tying them to a galvanized iron link.
Then it was soaked for a while to shrink it before it was set
in place. After the rope had shrunk sufficiently, the two
stakes were driven into the bed of the river, one close to the
bank and the other far enough out to hold the rope belt clear
of the bottom. Both stakes were sawed off under water, just
above the ring bolts, so that they were hidden from sight.
When we wanted to moor our boats we secured their anchor
ropes or &#8220;painters&#8221; to the link. A large stepping stone
marked the spot were the inner stake was driven, and standing
on this stone we were able to reach down and haul in on
the lower strap of the belt to draw the boat out a safe distance
from shore, and then when we wanted to use our boat again
we would haul in the upper strap to draw the boat in
toward shore.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>At night we used a torch in place of a
flag. The torch consisted of a roll of
dried birch bark tied with wire to the
end of a staff. It was found necessary
to place another torch on the ground directly
in front of the signaler so as to fix
a central point and enable one to determine
whether the moving torch was
swung to the left or right. A later improvement
was to use three lanterns,
one in each hand and one attached to the
waist to fix the central position. It was
quite an advantage to have a lantern in
each hand, for it saved changing over from one to the other
when a second movement followed a first or a first movement
a second.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Heliograph.</p>

<p>The book that Uncle Ed sent us had in it a description of
a heliograph, that is, an instrument for sending signals with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
flashes of sunlight. Although our wigwagging system was
good enough for our requirements, yet we thought it would
be more scientific to use the sun instrument, and besides, the
latter could be used for signaling many miles.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Single Mirror Instrument.</p>

<p>The first thing we did was to procure a small mirror about
4 inches square, mounted in a wooden frame. Then we got

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 153. Trunnion for Mirror.
</span>
</span>
a pair of small square head bolts about 1/4 of an inch in
diameter and 1 inch long, also two strips of brass 1/2 inch
wide and 3 inches long. In the center of each brass strip we
drilled a hole just large enough to admit the shank of one
of the bolts, and then the strips were fastened with screws
tight against opposite edges of the mirror
frame, with the heads pressed against the
frame and the shanks sticking out at each
side, as shown in Fig. 153. These projecting
shanks served as &#8220;trunnions&#8221;
(that is, pivots) for the mirror to turn on
when it was mounted in place. After the
trunnions had been set in place we made a
peep hole in the center of the mirror by cutting
out a piece of the wooden back of the
frame and scratching away the silver from
the back of the glass. Only a very small hole was required,
about 1/8 inch in diameter. Great care was taken to have
the unsilvered spot exactly on a line with the trunnions and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
just half-way between them. This done, we took two sticks

</span>
of 3/8-inch wood, 1 inch wide and 3-1/2 inches long. In
the upper end of each stick a slot was cut 1/2 inch deep and
1/4 inch wide. Into these slots the trunnions
of the mirror were
placed, and then the
nuts were screwed
tightly on, clamping
the sticks against
the sides of the
mirror. The sticks
were now connected
by nailing a 1/2-inch strip
at the bottom, and braced
by a couple of corner pieces.
This formed a swiveled frame
for the mirror, which was clamped
to the base of the instrument by
means of a bolt 1-1/2 inches long.
The bolt passed through the bottom board of the frame,
squarely under the peep hole of the mirror and through the
baseboard of the instrument near one end. The baseboard
was 2 inches wide, 10 inches long and 3/4 inch thick.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Sight Rod.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>At the end opposite to where the mirror frame was
swiveled we mounted a sight rod, which was merely a round
stick of wood 1/2 inch in diameter and about 8 inches long.
We cut the stick from one of the rounds
of an old broken chair. The upper end
<span class='image-left'>

</span>
</span>
of the rod was whittled to a point and one
side was flattened as shown in Fig. 155.
Out of a piece of heavy white cardboard
we cut a round disk about 1/4 inch in
diameter, with a shank 1 inch long sticking
out at one side. This was fastened with a
single tack to the flattened end of the rod
in such a position that the point lay exactly against the center
of the disk. The disk could then be turned up or down, to
cover or uncover the point of the rod, as desired. The rod
was fitted snugly into a hole in the

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
baseboard, and could be raised
or lowered to any extent desired,
but we had to provide some sort
of an arrangement for making it
stay where it was put. A small
hole was drilled from the edge of the baseboard through to
the hole in which the rod was fitted. A square socket was
chiseled out around the small hole to receive a nut. The nut
was firmly wedged in and held in place by driving in nails
along the edges. A bolt or machine screw was threaded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
through the nut, so that its inner end pressed against the
sighting rod. By tightening this screw the rod could be secured
at any height desired.</p>

<p>The instrument was mounted on a tripod similar to the
one used for our surveying instrument. To this it was attached
by means of a bolt, which passed through the center
of the baseboard and the tripod head.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Screen.</p>

<p>The screen, or shutter, of the heliograph was mounted on
a separate tripod, so as to prevent shaking the mirror when
it was operated. It was made something like a window
shutter. We cut out two slats, each 2-1/2 inches wide and 6
inches long. They were made of hardwood 3/8 inch thick.
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i164'></a><img src='images/fig-157.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 157. Section through Shutter.
</span>
</span>
The upper and lower edges were tapered
down to a thickness of 3/16 inch. Light
nails were driven into the slats at the ends,
and the nail heads were then filed off so
that the projecting ends formed trunnions
for the slats to turn on. The slats were
linked to a connecting rod with double
point tacks. A small double point tack
was driven into the upper edge of each
slat about 1/2 inch from the right
hand end. Then through each of
these tacks we hooked a second double
point tack and drove it into the rod.
The tacks on the rod were placed just 2 inches apart. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
substantial frame was then made of 3/4-inch stuff 1-1/2 inches
wide. The frame was square, with an opening that measured
6 inches each way, into which the slats were fitted. Before
nailing the frame together we drilled holes in the side pieces
for the trunnions of the slats to turn in. These holes were
just 1-3/4 inches apart. After the slats had been set in place,
the frame was fastened together and then nailed to a baseboard,

which was fastened
by a bolt to the
tripod. The shutter
was operated by a key
something like a
telegraph key. It
was made of a narrow
stick of wood
hinged at one end to
the lower strip of
the shutter frame,
and a spool sawed
in two was fastened
to the other
end to serve as a
handle for the
key. A string
connected the key with the connecting rod. The slats were
kept closed by a spring, which was fastened at one end to the
connecting rod and at the other to the top of the frame. At
first we used a rubber band for this purpose, but it soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
wore out, so we then made a spiral spring out of stiff spring
brass wire by wrapping it around a pencil. When the key
was pressed down the slats would be turned open, as shown
in Fig. 159; but as soon as the key was released the spring
would pull them back again.</p>

Fig. 159. The Heliograph in Operation.
</p>
</div>

<p>We were now ready to commence operations with our
instruments. The heliograph was set up on the ledge at the
top of the cliff. First the disk was turned down, uncovering
the point of the sighting rod. Then Bill sighted through the
unsilvered spot in the mirror and shifted the rod up and
down until the tip end came squarely in line with the door of
our straw hut, where Jack was seated, notebook in hand,
to take down our message. Reddy stood by him with his
wigwag flag to answer back. When the instrument was
properly sighted the shutter was set up directly in front of
it and the sighting disk turned up to cover the point of the
sighting rod. Then came the rather troublesome task of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
focusing the mirror. The mirror reflected a square panel of
light, in the center of which there was a small shadow spot
made by the unsilvered peep hole. The object was to get
this shadow to fall on the center of the sighting disk. We
knew that then the mirror would reflect the sunlight squarely
on the straw hut. We found it quite easy to direct this
shadow spot to the disk by holding a sheet of paper in front
of the mirror six or eight inches away, and following up the
spot on the paper until it reached the disk.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Heliograph Signaling.</p>

<p>When at last we succeeded in properly focusing the mirror
Bill pressed the key down three times, sending three quick
flashes to Jack as a signal that he was ready to begin. Reddy
wigwagged back O. K., and then the first heliographic
message was sent from the ledge to
the island. It was a rather mixed-up

</span>
message, and
kept Jim and
Reddy wigwagging
back and
forth very
strenuously to
straighten matters
out. It was my duty to keep the mirror focused. As the
sun moved across the sky the shadow spot would move off the
disk, and I had to keep shifting the mirror to bring the spot
back where it belonged. We used the International Telegraph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
Code, which we had been studying every evening for a week,
but it was many weeks before we learned how to use it
correctly, even slowly. The International Telegraph Code
is as follows:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_illus168'></a><img src='images/illus-168.png'  alt='' />
</div>

<p>The three short flashes Bill sent represented the letter S,
which stood for the word &#8220;signal.&#8221; A was formed by a
short flash followed by a long flash; B by a long flash followed
by three short ones, and so on. The key was held
down three times as long for the long flash as for the short
one. We found the best way of learning to send the signals
properly was to count 1 for each short flash, and for each
pause between parts of the letter, and 3 for each dash and
for each pause between letters. Between words we counted
6. Thus, for the letter A the key would be down when we
counted 1, up when we counted 2, down while we counted
3, 4, 5, and up while we counted 6, 7, 8, for the pause after
each letter. It was rather a confusing code, I admit, but in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
time we mastered it, all but Reddy and Fred, who never
would learn, but instead used the wigwag code, letting a
short flash stand for 1, a long flash for 2 and a double long
flash for 3.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Double Mirror Instrument.</p>

<p>Our heliographing instrument did excellent service sending
flashes from the cliff to the island, but we couldn&#8217;t make
it work very well sending messages from the island to the
cliff, because we had to face almost due north, and then the
sun was nearly always at our backs and couldn&#8217;t shine squarely
on the mirror. This led to our building a double mirrored
heliograph the following summer. To begin with, we built
an instrument which was the exact duplicate of our first
heliograph; then, in addition, to fit in the socket of the sighting
rod, we rigged up a second mirror, which was mounted
in exactly the same way as the first. The second mirror was
called the station mirror, and differed from the other, or sun

mirror, in having a
small patch of white
paper pasted at the
center instead of a
peep hole. When
using this instrument,
we set it up so that the station
mirror faced the ledge, then
by sighting through the hole
in the sun mirror at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
reflection in the station mirror we could see just what was
in focus. The station mirror had to be moved until the patch
at its center hid the ledge from view. After that the sun
mirror was shifted until the shadow spot fell on the white
patch of the station mirror. When once the station mirror
was focused, it could be clamped tightly in place by screwing
up the trunnion and swivel nuts. But the sun mirror had to
be constantly shifted to keep the shadow on the patch. Another
way of focusing the mirrors was to stand behind the
instrument with the head close to the station mirror, shift the

mirror was reflected in it, with
the white patch
squarely over the
unsilvered spot;
then still looking
at the sun mirror,
the station mirror
was shifted until
the reflection of the distant station was brought squarely in
line with the unsilvered spot on the mirror. The station
mirror was now firmly bolted and the sun mirror adjusted
until the shadow spot fell on the paper patch.</p>

<p>As our vacation was drawing to a close, we began to make
plans for the Christmas holidays. Our previous Christmas
vacation had been so completely taken up with preparations
for the trip to Willow Clump Island that we had had no
time for the trip itself. We resolved this time to have
everything ready beforehand, so that we could spend the entire
two weeks in solid pleasure. Our skate sails and snow
shoes were stored in the attic, ready for use. If we were to
make a trip in the snow we would need a sledge, and then,
too, we wanted to make an ice boat. It would hardly pay
to build these on the island and then cart them home, so it
was decided to break up camp a couple of weeks before
school commenced.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Breaking Camp.</p>

<p>Consequently, on the first day of September we gathered
up our belongings, corraled our chickens, packed our goods,
and the next day started for home. Mr. Schreiner, in response
to a letter from the secretary, came down with a
large wagon in which the majority of the things were packed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
The rest of our luggage was stowed in the scow and the
canoes, and these were towed down the canal, as before.
We reached home late in the afternoon, tired and hungry.
It was a treat to sit at the table again and eat some of
Mother&#8217;s appetizing dishes. And say, wasn&#8217;t that pie great,
though! My, how ravenous we were! And then a soft,
comfortable bed with spotless white sheets and pillow cases.
How soundly we did sleep that night! You can just bet
we were all glad enough to get back to civilization, though,
of course, no one could have dragged out the confession
from a single one of us.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Ice Boat.</p>

<p>School commenced on the 20th of September that year,
so we hadn&#8217;t much time to spare. Work was begun immediately
on the ice boat. Our first ice boat was rather a
crude one. A 2 by 4 inch scantling 14 feet long was
used for the backbone of the boat. The scantling was

placed on edge, and to lighten it and improve its appearance
it was tapered fore and aft from a point 4 feet from the bow
end. The thickness of the ends of the backbone was but 2
inches, as shown in Fig. 163. To the under edge of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
backbone, 5 feet from the forward end, a crosspiece was
nailed. This crosspiece was a 1-inch board 6 inches wide
and 9 feet long. Braces were then

to the forward

the backbone, and
at the rear end
several boards nailed
across the braces served as a
seat for the boat.</p>

<p>Our next task was to rig up the runners. For these we
used skates, which were so arranged that we could remove
them whenever we wanted to. Three blocks of wood were
used for the runner shoes. Two of

them were cut from a 2 by 4 scantling
and measured a foot in length. The
third block was only 1 inch thick, but
was otherwise of the same dimensions. The skates were
laid face downward on the blocks with the clamping levers
open; then we marked the places where the clamping jaws
touched the wood and drilled holes at these points. The
forward end of each block was also tapered off to fit flat
against the face of the skate. Then by inserting the jaws

the levers, the
skate was clamped to

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
would be to a shoe. The two 2-inch blocks were bolted to
the ends of the crosspiece, but the third block needed further
attention, as it was to be used for the rudder or steering
runner.</p>

<p>The rudder post was shaped from a block of hardwood
3 inches square and 10 inches long. Two inches from the
lower end saw cuts were made in

the side of the block to a depth of
3/4 inch. Then with a chisel the
sides were split off, forming a large
pin with a square shank 8 inches long. Next the corners of
the shank were cut off, rounding it to a diameter of 1-1/2
inches. The runner block was fastened securely to the head of
the rudder post with screws. A 1-1/2-inch hole was now drilled
into the backbone at the stern end to receive the rudder post.
A tiller was next cut out of a 1-inch board to the shape
shown in Fig. 167. A slot was

8 feet long, tapering from a diameter
2 inches at the base to 1-1/2 inches at the top. A step for the
mast was cut from a 2 by 4 block 8 inches long. A 2-inch
hole was drilled into the face of this block. We had no drill
large enough to bore this hole, but accomplished the same
result by drilling eight 1/2-inch holes inside of a 2-inch circle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
(Fig. 168), and then used a chisel to cut off the projecting
pieces. The mast step was firmly bolted to the backbone
at its thickest part, that is, just four feet

from the forward end. The mast
was braced with stay ropes
stretched from the top to the
forward end of the backbone
and to the ends of the crosspiece.
A 9-foot pole,
tapering from 1-1/2 inches
to 1 inch in diameter,
was used for the
boom of the
mainsail, and for
the gaff we used
a 6-foot pole of
the same diameter.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the mainsail are given in Fig. 169.
For mast hoops we used curtain rings. Five were attached
to the sail along the luff, and one was fastened with a piece
of leather to the end of the gaff. We used a different scheme

the mast, and were kept from slipping off by a piece of rope
passed around the mast and threaded through the ends of
the cheek blocks. Half a dozen small pulley blocks were
now procured, of the type used on awnings. A rope called
the throat halyard was strung from the throat or forward end
of the gaff through a pulley block near the top of the mast,
and led down to the backbone, where it was &#8220;belayed,&#8221; or
wrapped around a cleat. The cleat, which was whittled out
of a stick of wood, was made in the
form indicated in Fig. 171. A short
length of rope was strung through a
pulley block and tied with some slack
to the upper end and to the center of
the gaff. This rope is called a
&#8220;bridle,&#8221; and to the pulley block on
this &#8220;bridle&#8221; a rope was attached called the &#8220;peak halyard.&#8221;
The peak halyard was passed through a pulley
block at the top of the mast, and belayed on a cleat at the
side of the backbone. For the main sheet (that is, the rope
used for guiding the mainsail) two pulley blocks were
fastened to the backbone, one just in front of the seat and
the other a few feet further forward, and two more were
lashed to the boom, midway between these blocks. The
sheet was fastened near the aft end of the backbone and then
strung through the blocks in the order illustrated, the free
end of the sheet being brought back to the seat, where a cleat
was provided, to which it could be secured when desired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>The jib-sail was now cut out to the dimensions given in
Fig. 172. The foot of the sail was lashed to a jib-boom
3 feet 4 inches long. The jib-boom was attached
to the backbone at its fore end by means of a
couple of screw eyes. The eye of one of
these was pried open, linked through the
other and then closed again. One of
the screw eyes was now screwed into
the head of the jib-boom and the other
was threaded into the end of the backbone.
The upper corner or &#8220;head&#8221;
of the jib was tied to a jib-halyard, which passed through a
block at the top of the mast, and was secured on a cleat on the
backbone. On the jib we used two sheets. They were attached

them.</p>

<p>This completed
our
ice boat,
and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
very pretty little boat she was. It was with great reluctance
that we furled the sails, unstepped the mast, and stowed
away the parts in our attic until old Jack Frost should wake
up and furnish us with a field of smooth ice.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Sledge.</p>

<p>Our sledge was patterned after a picture of one used by
Peary in one of his Arctic expeditions. First we got four
strips of hickory 1 inch thick, 1-1/2 inches wide and 8 feet
long for the runners and side rails. Beginning 18 inches
from the ends, each stick was tapered gradually to a thickness
of 1/2 an inch. Then we made eight spreaders or
<span class='image-right'>

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 174. A Spacing Block.
</span>
</span>
spacing blocks, each 1-1/2 inches
thick, 2-1/2 inches wide and 11
inches long. In each end a notch
1/2 inch deep was cut to receive the
runners and side rails. In the edge
of each block, midway of its length,
a slot 1 inch deep was cut to receive the cross sticks of the
sledge. First we nailed the runners and rails to the blocks,
fastening them with screws, spacing the blocks 16 inches
from the ends, and 20 inches apart from center to center.
Then we bent the ends of the rails and runners together,
fastening them with bolts, as in Fig. 175. Four crosspieces,
or floor beams, were cut out of a 1-inch board, each 2 inches
wide and 30 inches long. These were fitted into the slots
in the space blocks and secured with screws. A cross stick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
was also fastened between the rails and runners at the forward
end. On the floor beams we nailed a flooring of
1/2-inch slats, 2 inches wide and 6 feet long. At the rear
end these slats projected 8 inches beyond the last space block
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i182'></a><img src='images/fig-175.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 175. The Runners and Rails Spaced Apart.
</span>
</span>
and over them a cross slat was nailed. A stick of hickory
4-1/2 feet long was soaked in hot water, as described on page
39, and was bent to an U-shape. The ends were then fitted
over the first cross stick, and under the first floor supports,
and securely nailed in place. Another stick of hickory 6
feet long was similarly bent, and the ends slipped over the
rear cross slats and fitted against the rear space blocks, in
which position the stick was securely nailed.</p>

<p>It was our intention to shoe the runners
with strips of brass, but these were not
procurable in our village, and we had no time to go down to
<span class='image-right'>

Millville. However, the village blacksmith came to our
rescue and shod our sledge with sleigh runner iron.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>We had planned to make two more devices for our winter
sports&#8211;a toboggan and a peculiar looking contrivance called
a &#8220;rennwolf,&#8221; a picture of which Dutchy happened to unearth
in one of his father&#8217;s books. Unfortunately Bill and
I had to return to school before either of these was completed.
However, the work was entrusted to Reddy, who
was quite handy with tools, and Jack, who was made secretary
<i>pro tempore</i>, took notes on the work.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Toboggan.</p>

<p>The toboggan was made of light flexible hickory boards,
1/4 of an inch thick, 6 inches wide and 8 feet long. Three
of these boards were used, and they were fastened together
with cross sticks or battens, about 3 inches wide and 1/2 an
inch thick. There were six of these battens spaced about
15 inches apart, and secured to the floor boards with flathead
screws introduced from the under side and countersunk so
that the heads would not project below the bottom of the
toboggan. At the forward end we screwed on a head piece
of oak, 3/4 of an inch thick, 1-1/2 inches wide and 20 inches
long. The head piece was fastened to the under side of the
boards, so that when they were curved up into a hood it
would lie on top. The ends of the head piece, which projected
1 inch each side of the boards, were notched to hold
the rope, which was tied fast after the boards had been
steamed. The boards were steamed by wrapping them in
burlap for a distance of 2 feet from the forward end, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
pouring boiling water over them, as was done with the

snow shoes (page 39). Before bending the boards we had
fixed screw eyes in the ends of each batten, except the forward
one; a rope had been strung
through these screw eyes and the
ends were now tied to the head piece and drawn tight so as
to bend the boards into a graceful curve. In this way the
ropes were of service not only for curving the front end into
a hood, but also for side rails, to hold on by when shooting
swiftly around curves.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Rennwolf.</p>

<p>The runners of the rennwolf were made of hickory strips,
1 inch thick, 2 inches wide and 8
feet long. At their forward ends
these strips were tapered down to a thickness of 1/2 an
inch and curved upward. About 30 inches from the rear
end of each runner an upright post was nailed. The post
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
was 3 feet long and was braced by a diagonal
brace 24 inches long, as shown in
Fig. 179. A tie bar was nailed to the
post about 6 or 8 inches from the bottom and connected with
the forward curved end of the runner.</p>

<p class='center caption'>
Fig. 179. Dimensions of Rennwolf.
</p>
</div>

<p>The two runners were now placed parallel to each other
about 18 inches apart, and connected by four cross bars, one
at the forward end, and three on the upright posts, in about
the positions illustrated. The upper cross bar was extended
6 inches beyond the posts at each side, and served as a handle
for guiding the queer craft. An 18-inch square board was
used for the seat of the rennwolf. It rested on the second
cross-bar of the post about 12 inches from the runners, and
the forward end was supported on legs nailed to the tie bars.
On each runner back of the posts a loop of leather was nailed,
large enough to receive the toe of one shoe.</p>

<p>When using this odd sled one foot would rest on the runner
with the toe in the strap, and by kicking out against the
snow or ice with the other foot the rennwolf would be made
to spin along at a rapid rate. Of course, when coasting both
feet would rest on the runners and the sled was steered by
an occasional side push at the right or left. Owing to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
great length of the runners the rennwolf would easily ride
over uneven surfaces and thin spots in the ice.</p>

<p>In order to provide a better hold for the propelling foot,
we fastened around the toe a strap of leather, through which
a number of long tacks projected. Their sharp points
would stick into the ice, and prevent the foot from slipping.
The seat of the rennwolf was convenient for carrying a coat
or any light luggage, and it was often used to give a friend
a very exhilarating ride.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SUBTERRANEAN CLUB.</span></h2>

<p>I am afraid we were not very glad to get back to school
that fall. It seemed very hard to give up the sport we had
been having, and our heads were brimful of new schemes
which we could hardly wait to put into practice. But we
soon learned that there are many things that could be done
during recreation hours at school. We had intended building
a cave on our island that summer, but our vacation came
to an end before we got around to it. There seemed no
reason why we shouldn&#8217;t dig one in the woods at the back
of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Cave-in.</p>

<p>Bill had read somewhere that if you dig a cave under a
tree the roots of the tree will support the ground on top and
make a natural and substantial roof. It sounded very
reasonable, we thought; in fact, we never questioned the truth
of the statement, because we had somehow gotten the notion
that books were never wrong, and that whatever was set up
in type must surely be so. But events proved that the man
who wrote that book had never attempted to build a cave
in the manner he described, at least not in the loose,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
sandy soil of south Jersey. A large spreading cedar was
selected as the tree which should support the roof of our
cave. It was situated on a mound at the edge of the woods.
First a passageway, or ditch, was dug at the bottom, and
then we begun tunneling in the side of the mound under the
roots of the tree. For a while the ground above held, and
our tunnel had reached a length of about four feet, when
suddenly, without the slightest warning, the sandy soil gave
way and we were engulfed. Bill, who was furthest within
the cave, was almost entirely covered, while I was buried to
the shoulders. A crowd of boys came to our assistance and
dug us out. Poor Bill was almost smothered before they
scooped the sand away from around his mouth and nose.
The boys made slow work of it, having to dig with their
hands and a couple of shingles, because the two spades we
had were buried with us at the bottom of the cave.</p>

<p>Of course, this little episode gave us a scare, but it was
only temporary. We swore every one to secrecy, so that
Mr. Clark, the principal, wouldn&#8217;t hear of the mishap and
suppress any further cave building. It was obvious that the
only roof we could depend on for our cave would be a
wooden roof. If we had been at Willow Clump Island we
would have gotten any amount of slabs from the lumber
mills across the river.</p>

<p>One of our schoolmates, a day scholar, came to the rescue.
His name was Chester Hill, a little bit of a chap, about the
shortest for his age that I have ever seen. His name was
so at variance to his size that we called him &#8220;Hillock,&#8221; for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
short. Now Hillock lived on a farm about eight miles from
school, and used to drive in every day on a farm wagon.
He had helped us dig the cave under the cedar tree, and
when he learned that we would need some lumber to build a
safe cave, he told us that he had an uncle who owned a
lumber mill on the Morris River, from whom he was sure
we could get all the slabs we wanted. Of course, we were
delighted, and laid our plans for an elaborate cave house.
Hillock promised to be on hand on the following Saturday
afternoon with his load of lumber.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Excavating for the Cave.</p>

<p>We immediately set out to make the necessary excavation.
The side of a bushy knoll was chosen as a suitable site. First
we carefully transplanted the bushes that grew in the square
we had marked out for the cave, and cutting the sod into
squares, piled it all neatly to one side. Then we shoveled
away the top-soil and heaped it up for future use. After
that we dug away the sandy subsoil. The cave proper we
planned to make about 8 feet by 10 feet, with a passageway 2
feet wide and 6 feet long, leading in from a large bush at the
base of the knoll. Our excavation was therefore somewhat
T-shaped (see Fig. 182). At the deepest part we had to
dig down about 10 feet.</p>

Fig. 182. Excavation for the Cave.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>The digging was all done by Saturday, when Hillock
pulled up with a big load of slabs. Slabs are a very unsatisfactory
kind of wood for most purposes. Being the outside
cut, they are usually very irregular and weak in spots. In
many places they are almost clear bark. Of course, had our
pocketbooks permitted, we would have used stout scantlings
for the corner posts of our cave house and substantial boards
for the walls, roof and flooring, but we had to be content
with materials at hand. Eight of the best slabs were selected
for our corner posts; four of them we cut to the length of
8 feet and the others to a length of 6 feet. The long slabs
were set up at the rear of the cave, two at each corner, one
flat against the rear wall, with its edge buried in the corner,
and the other against the side wall, with its edge tight against
the rear slab, as in Fig. 183. The same was done at the

forward corners
with the shorter
slabs. A couple
of slabs were now
set up on each
side of the
passageway, and
a corresponding
pair against the
rear wall. The
upper and lower ends of the uprights were then connected
with slabs, called stringpieces.</p>

<p>The sides were now boarded up with upright slabs nailed
to the stringpieces. An opening 3 feet 6 inches high was left
in the forward wall for a passageway. Several slabs were

</span>
now placed on the edge across the bottom of the cave, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
serve as floor beams, upon which a flooring of slabs was
laid. Next the rafters were set in place, one on each upright
slab. Slots were cut in the ends of the uprights to receive
the rafters, which were slabs placed on edge. As the forward
uprights were 2 feet shorter than the rear ones, the
rafters were given a good slant, so that the roof would
properly shed any water that might soak in through the
ground above.</p>

<p class='center caption'>
Fig. 185. Notching in the Rafters.
</p>
</div>

<p>The roof was laid
on the same way that
we had made the roof
of our tree house; that
is, a slab was first
nailed at the forward
end of the rafters with
its edge projecting far
enough to make a good eave; then the second slab was nailed
on, with its edge overlapping the first, and a third with its
edge overlapping the second, and so on with the rest. At
the rear end of the roof a hole was cut, into which we fitted
a piece of stovepipe. We didn&#8217;t plan to have a fire in the
house, but set the stovepipe in place to provide the necessary
ventilation. As the pipe had an elbow in it, there was no
danger of rain or dirt falling through it. The upper end of
the stovepipe was concealed among some rocks at the top
of the knoll.</p>

<p>A suitable flooring was now laid in the passageway, and
the sides were boarded up to a height of 2 feet from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
floor at the entrance to a height of 3 feet 6 inches at the
inner end. A roof of slabs was nailed on, and then we were
ready to cover our slab house with dirt.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Covering the Cave.</p>

<p>We avoided piling on the dirt very deep, because there
was danger of breaking in the roof with a heavy load. A
thin layer of sand covered with the top-soil brought up the
level to about that of the rest of the knoll. Then the sod
was laid back in place and well watered, and the few bushes
planted back in their original positions. Our sodding should
have been done in the spring for best results. The frost soon
killed the grass, and the bushes withered away. But a few
cents&#8217; worth of grass seed was sowed in, and in time gave
the knoll a very natural appearance. A bush at the bottom
concealed the entrance of the cave, so that no one who was
not in the secret would have suspected that beneath that
innocent looking knoll were gathered the members of the

<p>Of course, we had to organize a secret society, to occupy
our subterranean dwelling. In that I fear we overstepped
the rules of the school. Of course, Mr. Clark knew of our
cave, in fact he visited us there once, lowering his dignity
sufficiently to squeeze into the narrow passageway, and
playing Bill a game of chess at our club table. He seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
quite pleased with our work, and complimented us very
highly on the masterful way in which we had built the underground
house. We told him that we had organized a club
of the older fellows to play indoor games and have occasional
spreads, but we did not tell him that most of our spreads
were held at the dead of night, when there was no moon and
the stars were hidden by clouds. At 10 o&#8217;clock each night
the bell rang for us to turn out our lights, and after that the
six members would each, in turn, keep a half-hour watch, that
is, first one would sit up and try to keep awake for half an
hour, after which he would waken the next fellow, who at
the end of a half hour would rouse the third, and so on, until
1 o&#8217;clock, when the sixth watcher would wake up the entire
club. Then we would all creep out the back window in the
hall, onto the roof of the rear annex of the schoolhouse, and
thence climb down a rope ladder to the ground.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Midnight Banquets.</p>

<p>I suppose we could have just as easily have tiptoed downstairs
and out the back door, but it would have spoiled the
romance of it all. The absolute stillness and the pitch-black
darkness of the night were awe-inspiring. The roll of a
pebble or the crack of a twig under foot would set us all
atingle as we stole out to our cave house. Sometimes the
night was so black that we could hardly find the entrance of
the cave. Once inside, in the light of a few candles, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
nervous tension was relieved, and we reveled in a banquet
of cold victuals and dainties, purchased out of the monthly
club dues. Our meetings in the cave lasted scarcely half an
hour. In fact, the meeting, and even the banquet, were mere
incidentals. The main enjoyment consisted in stealing out
to the cave and back again, always at the risk of getting
caught. Usually when we got to bed again we would be too
excited to fall asleep right away, and when we did finally
drop off our sleep was so sound that several times the breakfast
bell caught one or more of us still napping.</p>

afforded was the wearing of a mysterious
club pin. It was a silver beetle, with the
letter G engraved on the head and the letter
B on the body, while down the center of the
back was the letter I (see Fig. 187). In
public we called ourselves the G. I. B.&#8217;s, but
it was only the initiated members who knew that these letters
were to be read backward, and, with the beetle on which they
were engraved, signified the &#8220;Big Bugs.&#8221; Of course, we
had some secret signs and signals, a secret hand grasp, a
peculiar whistle as a warning to run, another meaning &#8220;lie
still,&#8221; and a third signifying &#8220;all is well.&#8221;</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Combination Lock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>We found it necessary to close the entrance of our cave
with a door fastened with a padlock, so as to keep meddlers
out. The entire school had watched us build the cave house,
and, of course, knew just where our entrance lay. Then, in
addition to the outer door, we put in another one, half-way
down the dark passageway. On this Bill rigged up a simple
combination lock which would baffle any one who managed
to pick the padlock. This inner door opened outward. It
was hinged to the floor of the passageway, and swung up
against a frame set in the passageway. At the top was a
board whose lower edge lay flush with the edge of the door
when it was closed. For the combination lock we used a
couple of spools, each with one head cut off and the central
hole plugged up with a stick of wood. In the floor and the
top board of the frame, holes were drilled just large enough
for the shanks of the spools to fit snugly in them. Next we
made a trip to a hardware store for a file and a couple of

large copper washers, about 1-1/4 inches in diameter. The
washers were fastened to the inner ends of the spools after
they had been pushed through the hole. The washer on
the door came just to the edge of the door, while the other
extended below the door frame and lapped under the door
washer. Then in the edge of the washer on the frame a
notch was filed, while in the other washer two notches were
filed, so as to leave a tooth which fitted snugly into the notch
of the first washer (see Figs. 188, 189). The door was

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
locked by turning both the washers until the notch and tooth
came in line with each other, then pushing the tooth through
the notch, and turning the washers so that the frame washer
hooked over the door washer. Then the door could be
opened only when the tooth and notch were brought in line.</p>

<p>On the head of each spool
we pasted a disk of white
cardboard, the edge of which
was graduated, as in Fig. 190.
Then we had a secret combination,
say 11-19, which
meant that when the spools
were turned so that the number
11 on the door spool came
in line with the number 19 on the frame spool the tooth and

notch would be in line, and the door could then be opened.
Of course, this combination was known to the members of
the club only, and any one outside who tried to open the
door might have tried for some time without bringing the
tooth and notch into line with each other. Occasionally
we changed the combination by loosening the screws which
held the washers, and turning them
so that the notch and tooth came
opposite different numbers on the
dials. This was done so that if
any one should chance to learn our
combination he could not make use
of it very long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Dutchy! What in thunder have you got there?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Bill who spoke. We were on our way home for
the winter holidays, and had been held up at Millville by
Reddy Schreiner, who had informed us that Dutchy was
down by the river with the boat to give us a sail up to
Lamington.</p>

<p>A vision of a fleet ice boat skimming up the river at express
train speed swam before our eyes. But the next moment,
as we turned the corner into River Street, we were
surprised by the sight of our old scow just off the pier at
anchor, and in open water. It was rigged up with a jib
and mainsail, which were flapping idly in the wind. It had
also been altered by decking over the top, with the exception
of a small cockpit, evidently for the purpose of keeping out
the water when she heeled over under the wind. We were
disappointed and quite annoyed at not finding the ice boat
on hand; furthermore, our annoyance was considerably
heightened by Dutchy&#8217;s broad grin of evident delight at our
discomfiture. &#8220;The river wasn&#8217;t all frozen over,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;and we couldn&#8217;t bring the ice boat down, so we
rigged up the scow and she came down splendidly.&#8221;</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Sail in the Scow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>There was nothing to do but to jump in, though I, for one,
would have taken the train in preference had there been
one inside of two hours. Dutchy, however, seemed to be in
a surprisingly good humor, and kept up a lively chatter about
things that the club had made in our absence. The skis,
which have already been described on page 42, had been
built under Reddy&#8217;s guidance, and they had already used
them on Willard&#8217;s Hill, coasting down like a streak and
shooting way up into the air off a hump at the bottom. Then
there was the toboggan slide down Randall&#8217;s Hill, and way
across the river on the ice.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Our Craft Strikes the Ice.</p>

<p>Dutchy talked so incessantly that we hadn&#8217;t noticed the
field of ice which we were nearing. Just at this point Bill
turned around with an exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Dutchy, you crazy fellow, where are you going to?
Hard to port, man&#8211;hard aport&#8211;or you will crash into
the ice!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dutchy only grinned nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, you will smash the boat!&#8221; Bill cried again,
making a dive for the steering oar; but just then the boat
struck the ice, and both Bill and I were thrown backward
into the bottom of the boat. But the boat didn&#8217;t smash.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>There was a momentary grinding and crunching noise, and,
much to my surprise, I found that the old scow had lifted
itself clean out of the water, and was skating right along on
the ice. Then Dutchy could control himself no longer. He
laughed, and laughed, as if he never would stop. He laughed
until the steering oar dropped from his hands, and the old
scow, with the head free, swung around and plunged off
the ice ledge with a heavy splash into the open water again.
Then Reddy, who was almost equally convulsed, came to
his senses. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ve done it, Dutchy; you&#8217;re a fine
skipper, you are! How do you expect to get us back to shore
again?&#8221; The steering oar was left behind us on the ice, and
there we were drifting on the open water, with no rudder and
no oar to bring us back.</p>

<p>The only thing
we could do was to
wait until the wind
or current carried us
to the ice or land.
In the meantime Dutchy, who had suddenly sobered down
when we took our water plunge, explained how he had rigged
up the scow to travel both on ice and on water. He called
the rig a sled boat, but the name by which such a rig is now
known is a &#8220;scooter.&#8221; It was Dutchy&#8217;s idea primarily, but
Reddy had engineered the work. Along the bottom of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
scow two strips of hickory had been nailed to serve as runners.
The hickory strips had been bent up at the forward end, as
shown in Fig. 191. Each runner was shod with a strip of
brass, fastened on with flathead screws, which were countersunk,
so that the heads should not project below the brass.
This virtually made a sledge out of the old scow, and didn&#8217;t
spoil it for use on the water.</p>

<p class='center caption'>
Fig. 192. Mainsail of Scooter Scow.
</p>
</div>

<p>A sprit sail and
jib were rigged up.
The dimensions of
these sails, which
were taken from a
book in Mr. Van
Syckel&#8217;s library,
are given in the
illustrations. A
sheet of heavy
muslin was made
to measure 7 feet
square, as indicated by dotted lines in the drawing; then the
corners were cut off along the full lines shown in the illustration.
The edges were now hemmed all around, and the lower
edge of the sail was lashed to a boom, 7 feet 6 inches long.
To the luff were attached a number of mast rings, which were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
slipped over a stout mast projecting about 5 feet 6 inches
above the deck of the boat. The peak of the sail was held

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 193. The Snotter.
</span>
</span>
up by a spar called a sprit. The sprit was sharpened at each
end, and the point at the upper end was inserted in a loop of
heavy cord fastened to the peak of the sail,
while the lower point of the sprit rested in
the loop of a rope on the
mast, called a &#8220;snotter.&#8221; The
snotter was a short piece of rope
with a loop at each end. It was
wrapped around the mast, as shown
in the drawing, with one loop holding
it in place, like a slip knot, and the other
supporting the end of the sprit. A single
halyard was used to raise this sail. It was

<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 194. Jib-sail of Scooter Scow.
</span>
</span>
attached to the boat and passed over a block
in the mast. When raising the sail it was first
partly hoisted, then the sprit was hooked in
the loop and the snotter, after which the
throat halyard was drawn taut. Then the snotter
was pulled up the mast as far as it would go, flattening
out the sail. The jib-sail was made
out of the large corner piece left when cutting
the mainsail. The dimensions of
the jib-sail are given in Fig. 194.
It was such a small sail that no
boom was used with it. In place of
a rudder the steering oar had to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
used. This was made of a rake handle with a large trowel
blade fastened to the end of it. The sharp blade cut into the
ice, and so steered the scow when it was running as an ice
boat, and in the water the blade offered sufficient resistance
to act as a rudder.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Scooter Sailing.</p>

<p>But to return to our sail home to Lamington, we were not
out on the open water long before the current carried us
back to the ice ledge. Reddy jumped off and soon returned
with the steering oar; then we proceeded on our way homeward,
now in the water and now on ice. Once or twice the
scow was unable to climb out of the water, because she had
not sufficient headway, and was clumsy and heavy with four
boys aboard. Then we had to push off until we could get a
sufficient start. It struck me that while Dutchy was quite
clever to think of such a rig, yet it was very clumsy and
capable of much improvement. Bill wasn&#8217;t saying very much
all this time, and I could see he was doing a lot of thinking.
Evidently he was planning some improvement, but Bill was
a very considerate fellow, and did not want to spoil Dutchy&#8217;s
pleasure just then by telling him how much better a scooter
he might have built. It wasn&#8217;t until after supper, when
a meeting of the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I. was called, that
Bill came out with his scheme.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Meeting of the Society.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>&#8220;Why not mount the sailing canoe on runners, instead of
the scow? You would have a very light rig then, and it
would sail like a streak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Reddy, &#8220;your plan sounds first-rate,
but how are you going to fasten runners onto the
canoe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought all that out,&#8221; replied Bill. &#8220;If we can only
get hold of a pair of sleigh runners it won&#8217;t take long to rig
up the sled boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dutchy, who had looked rather crestfallen at a suggestion
of an improvement on his pet invention, now suddenly
brightened up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where we can get the sleigh runners!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Dad has an old ramshackle sleigh in the barn
that is just falling to pieces with dry rot. I&#8217;ll ask him for
it to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can get it?&#8221; inquired Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; Dutchy answered, rather doubtfully. &#8220;But
say, suppose we send a delegation to see him about it?&#8221;</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>An Interview with Mr. Van Syckel.</p>

<p>This was agreed upon, and in the morning, as soon as
breakfast had been downed, the entire society marched in a
body into Mr. Van Syckel&#8217;s library. I was appointed
spokesman, with Bill to back me, while the rest of the party
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
were strung out behind, with Dutchy bringing up the rear.
Mr. Van Syckel was not the man to take much interest in
boys&#8217; work, but we happened to strike him at the right moment,
and before our interview was over we had told him
all our experiences of the summer before and all our plans
for the future. Then we did a good turn for Dutchy, too.
Mr. Van Syckel had always considered his boy a &#8220;know-nothing,&#8221;
and was very much surprised to find that he had
invented the scooter scow. Why, he actually seemed proud
of his son, much to Dutchy&#8217;s embarrassment. After that
there was no trouble about getting the sleigh runners, and
Mr. Van Syckel forgot the objections he had offered at first.</p>

Fig. 195. Runners of Scooter Canoe.
</p>
</div>

<p>Naturally we were very much elated at our success, and
straightway made for the barn, where we began operations
on the scooter canoe. The sleigh was an old-fashioned affair,
with rather broad wooden runners. First we removed the
body of the sleigh, and then the runners were cut down to a
height of about 15 inches. We spaced them apart about
28 inches, and connected them with four crosspieces at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
top. The runners were now placed over our larger canoe,
with forward ends about on a line with the mast, and the
crosspieces were fastened with screws to the gunwales. As
an additional security, a pair of crosspieces were now run
under the canoe at each end and fastened with screws to the
keel. At the bow the keel was shod with a strip of brass.
The rudder was taken off the boat, and an oar lock was
fastened to the stern to hold the steering oar. In place of
lee boards we nailed a couple of thin boards over each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
runner, as shown in the drawing. We were in a hurry to
finish this, as our vacation was short, so we used on the
scooter canoe the sails that we had made for our ice boat.
This required a bowsprit, but as we had little time to spare
we used the jib-boom of the ice boat, nailing it to the deck
beam of the canoe. We decided that the jib-sail could be
used without a boom, as we had done with the scow. The
mast was braced by stays attached to the ends of the runners
and bowsprit. This spread of canvas was far greater than
that originally provided for sailing the canoe, but the heavy
runners on each side helped to keep the boat on even keel,
and then to further balance the sail a board was nailed across
the aft end of the boat. This overhung the runners about 18
inches each side, and in a strong wind we could sit out on the
windward end of this board, thus preventing the scooter
from heeling over too far.</p>

<p>As soon as our scooter canoe was completed we prepared
for the long-planned winter expedition to Willow Clump
Island. The weather conditions were ideal. We had had
ten days of steady cold weather, which had followed a heavy
fall of snow, so that we could tramp up the island on snow
shoes, or we could use our scooter canoe and scooter scow on
the river. It was out of the question to use our skate sails
or the ice boat on the river, and the canal would be serviceable
only in case the wind should blow from a southerly
quarter. But we stowed them on the sledge for use on
Lake Placid.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday morning following Christmas we made the
start. Bill in the scooter canoe and Dutchy in the scooter
scow sailed up the river, and the rest of us, on snow shoes,
took the tow path of the canal, hauling the sledge along. We
carried provisions for a week and a good supply of blankets.
The island was reached without mishap, except that Dutchy
had to be helped several times in dragging the heavy scow
around the rapids. Bill reached the island long before we
did, and after unloading the canoe came racing back under
a stiff breeze for a second load. Then he took his turn at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
hauling the sledge, while Reddy sailed the reloaded scooter
canoe up to the island.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Willow Clump Island in Winter.</p>

<p>We brought no tent with us, as we expected to take up
our quarters in the straw hut. When we reached the hut we
hardly recognized it. It was almost completely covered with
snow and looked like an Eskimo house. The snow had
drifted well up over the north side, completely closing the
entrance. We had to set to work at once with a shovel and
open up a passageway, and then we had to shovel out a large
pile of snow that had drifted into the hut from the open
doorway.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Kindling a Camp Fire.</p>

<p>In the meantime Jack scoured the island for some dry
wood. In this he was not very successful, because everything
was covered with snow, and when he tried to kindle a
fire in the open space in front of our hut he found the task
an exceedingly difficult one. Unfortunately we forgot to
bring the oil stove with us, and the prospect of something
warm to eat was exceedingly remote. We hadn&#8217;t yet learned
the trick of building a camp fire in wet weather. After exhausting
our stock of paper Fred and I started over to
Lumberville for several newspapers and a can of kerosene.
We went to old Jim Halliday&#8217;s, who had befriended us on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
one or two occasions the previous summer, and made known
to him our troubles.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! A can of oil to build yer fire with? Well, ye
won&#8217;t git it from me. I know a man as got blowed up
apourin&#8217; oil on a fire. Why, shucks, boys, you don&#8217;t need no
oil ner paper nuther on that there island. Its chuck-full of
silver birch trees, and there ain&#8217;t no better kindlin&#8217; than
birch bark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Birch bark! Why, yes, why hadn&#8217;t we thought of that?
We had used it for torches the summer before and knew
how nicely it burned. So back we skated to camp, and then,
peeling off a large quantity of bark from the birch trees
around us, we soon had a rousing big fire in front of the hut.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>But there were more things
to be learned about open fires.
In our summer outing Jack
had done most of his cooking
on a kerosene stove,
and he soon found that it
was a very different matter
to cook over an unsheltered
fire. The heat was constantly carried hither and thither by
the gusts of wind, so that he could scarcely warm up his
saucepans. We had to content ourselves with cold victuals
for the first meal, but before the next meal time came around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
we had learned a little more about fire building. Two large
logs were placed about 10 inches apart, and the space between
them was filled in with pieces of bark and small twigs
and sticks. The back of the fireplace was closed with
stones. One touch of a match was enough to kindle the fire,
and in a moment it blazed up beautifully. The logs at the
sides and the stones at the back prevented the wind from
scattering the flames in all directions, and a steady draft
poured through the open end of the fireplace and up through
the heart of the fire. The side logs were so close together
that our cooking utensils could be supported directly on them.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Stone-paved Fireplace.</p>

<p>The following summer we continued our open fireplace
experiments. Instead of using logs we drove stakes into
the ground, forming a small circular stockade about 2 feet
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i206'></a><img src='images/fig-198.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 198. A Stone-paved Fireplace.
</span>
</span>
high and 3 feet in diameter. A paving of small stones covered
the floor of the fireplace, and a lining of stones was laid
against the wall. The stakes were driven in on a slant, as
illustrated in Fig. 198, so as to better support the stone
lining. A break in the stockade at one side let in the necessary
draft. Two of the stakes on opposite sides of the fire
were made extra long, and were crotched at their upper
ends. They served to support the cross stick from which our
kettles were hung. This form of fireplace was more satisfactory
for baking than the one in which logs were used for
the side walls, because the stone lining retained the heat much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
longer. To bake biscuit, a pot of beans, or the like,
the ashes would be drawn away from the stone paving
and the pot placed directly on the hot stones, after which
it was covered with hot
embers and ashes.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Cold Night in the Hut.</p>

<p>But to return to our
experiences on the island.
We found it very cold on
the first night in the hut.
We were afraid to build
a fire inside lest the
straw thatchings would
catch fire, and so we
huddled together in the corner, rolled up tightly in our
blankets. But it was cold, nevertheless. We had no door
to close the opening into the hut, and instead had piled up
branches of cedar and hemlock against the doorway. But
a bitterly cold northwest wind was blowing down the river,
and we couldn&#8217;t keep warm, no matter what we did. Most
of the boys were ready to go right home, but we stuck it out
until the morning, and then after we had toasted ourselves
before a blazing bright fire, and had eaten a hot breakfast,
we forgot much of the discomfort of the night and were
ready for more &#8220;fun.&#8221; We thought we would spend the
next night in our tree house, and so, right after breakfast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
we packed up our blankets and some provisions and started
for the Jacob&#8217;s Ladder.</p>

<p>Each fellow was provided with a pair of ice creepers of
the same sort as we had used in connection with the rennwolf
(see page 170). In addition to this each boy was provided
with a home-made alpine stock, consisting of a stout wooden
stick in the end of which a large nail was driven and the
head filed off. Thus equipped we came to the foot of the
cliff, and much to our delight found it one mass of ice from
top to bottom. Now was our chance to try some Swiss
mountain climbing. Bill took the lead, with an old hatchet
in his hand, to hack out any necessary footholds in the ice
wall, and the rest of us strung out behind him tied to a long
rope, each boy about 10 or 12 feet from the one ahead. Bill
cautioned us to keep our distance, holding the rope taut in
one hand, so that if a fellow stumbled he could be kept from
falling either by the one in front or by the one behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if the rope drags on the ice, it is
liable to be cut or worn so that it will break when any strain
was put on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, one would think from all these precautions that we
were launched on a perilous expedition. That was the impression
we were trying to make on ourselves, though, as a
matter of fact, any one of us could have climbed the cliff
unaided and without any ice implements if he had used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
ordinary care not to slip on the ice-clad ladder rounds or the
snow-covered ledges.</p>

<p>The climb was without mishap and we reached our tree
house, only to find it so badly racked by storm and weather
that it was clearly out of the question to attempt to spend
the night there. The wind howled around the house and
whistled through dozens of cracks and chinks that had
opened in the walls. All that we could do, therefore, was
to turn back to the island and make the best of our straw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
hut again. On the way, however, we stopped at Lumberville
for some straw to be used for bedding. The afternoon
was spent sailing around on Lake Placid and the large
smooth stretch above the island.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Costly Camp Fire.</p>

<p>After supper Bill and Reddy went into the hut to arrange
the straw bedding, while the rest of us gathered wood for a
huge bonfire in front of the hut. The wind was blowing
right down the river and we expected it to carry the warmth
of the fire into the hut. The fire was built some distance
in front of the doorway, so as to prevent the hut from catching
fire. But we had evidently miscalculated the strength of
the wind, for no sooner was the fire fairly started than a
shower of flaming brands was blown right into the hut. In
a moment the straw blazed up, cutting off all escape for Bill
and Reddy. Fortunately the framing was not strong and
the frost had loosened up the foundations, so that a few
frantic kicks opened an exit in the rear of the hut just in
time to save our comrades from cremation. Once it was
fairly started we were powerless to put out the blaze until
the hut was ruined. The snow that covered the walls
checked the fire somewhat, but the thatching burned from
the inside, melting the snow and dropping it suddenly into
the flaming straw bedding on the floor. As we sat in a
gloomy ring about the camp fire, watching the tongues of
flame play about the charred ribs of our hut, we had reason
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
to be thankful that the wind had played its pranks before we
turned in for the night. What a risk we had run of being
all burned to death! It made me shudder to think of it.
Well, our hut was burned. What next? That was the
question put before the society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might build a snow hut,&#8221; suggested Dutchy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, be sensible,&#8221; answered Reddy. &#8220;We can&#8217;t build a
snow hut in five minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best plan,&#8221; I volunteered, &#8220;would be to go over
to Jim Halliday&#8217;s and ask him to let us sleep in his barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately the suggestion was acted upon.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Friend in Time of Trouble.</p>

<p>Old Jim Halliday greeted us very gruffly. He said he
wouldn&#8217;t have us in his barn. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be amussin&#8217; up the
hay so&#8217;t wouldn&#8217;t be fit fer the horses to eat. Any boy that
is fool enough to build a fire on a straw bed ought to go
right home to his mother, and he hadn&#8217;t oughter be trusted
with matches, nuther. He might get his fingers burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I caught a twinkle in the old man&#8217;s eyes and wasn&#8217;t
surprised to have him end his lecture by taking us into the
kitchen and seating us around an old-fashioned log fire while
&#8220;Marthy,&#8221; his daughter, made us some hot coffee to take
the chill out of our bones. We didn&#8217;t sleep in the barn that
night. The Hallidays had only one spare bed, hardly
enough for six boys, and the old man didn&#8217;t want to be partial
to any two of us, but his daughter solved the difficulty by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
dragging down two large feather mattresses and laying them
on the kitchen floor in front of the hearth.</p>

<p>Before bidding us &#8220;good night,&#8221; Mr. Halliday put on his
sternest expression and bade Marthy clear out all the matches
from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest as like as not they&#8217;ll set fire to the house,&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;I expect this is my last night on airth.&#8221; And
then, with a solemn warning not to hang our clothes on the
flames, and to &#8220;keep them feather beds offen the embers,&#8221;
he left us to a comfortable night&#8217;s rest.</p>

<p>In the morning, after we had disposed of all the hot
griddle cakes we could eat, and had sincerely thanked our
host and hostess for their hospitality, we wended our way
back to the island, silently packed up our goods and started
home for Lamington.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this isn&#8217;t going to happen again,&#8221; was Bill&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;Next year we&#8217;ll have a log cabin on the island.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /><span class='h2fs'>TRAMPING OUTFITS.</span></h2>

<p>Our winter expedition to Willow Clump Island filled us
with a wholesome respect for Arctic explorers. If we could
find it so uncomfortable with the thermometer only at 10
degrees above zero, what would it be to endure a temperature
of 40, 50 or even 60 degrees below zero? We were interested
to learn how they managed to stand it. This led to
a study of the subject in Mr. Van Syckel&#8217;s library.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Sleeping Bags.</p>

<p>In one of the books Dutchy came across the description of
a sleeping bag. It was made of reindeer&#8217;s skin sewed into
a large bag with the fur side turned in. This bag was large
enough to hold three or four sleepers, and each man was
covered with a pair of woolen bags, one bag slipped inside
the other. The woolen bags were made of blankets sewed
together and provided with flaps at the upper ends to cover
the head of the sleeper.</p>

<p>Of course, we had to make a sleeping bag, too. The innermost
bag was made of an old quilt and the next one of a
blanket that we were fortunate enough to get hold of. But
when it came to the reindeer skin we were balked, until we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
happened to run across a piece of rubber sheeting at the
village store. This was a lucky find, for I doubt if one
country store in a hundred carries such stock. The piece
was just large enough to cover the blanket bag and allow
for an ample flap to cover the head. To be sure, this furnished
a shelter for only one person, and there were six in the
society. It was clear that the treasury could not afford the
expense of six sleeping bags; but as such a device would be
useful only under very unusual circumstances we decided that
two sleeping bags would be all the society would need. We
had been rather curious to explore the country back of the
hills on the Pennsylvania side of the river, and with some
light provisions and these sleeping bags strapped to the back
a couple of boys could make quite an extended tour, unmindful
of weather conditions. On real hot nights a fellow
could get into the quilt bag and sleep on the blanket and
waterproof bag. In cold weather the combination of all three
bags provided sufficient warmth. The rubber bag would
protect the sleeper from any moisture in the ground, and
would also keep him thoroughly dry, even in a pouring rain.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Bill&#8217;s &#8220;Mummy Case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our second sleeping bag was Bill&#8217;s own design, and was, in
many respects, an improvement on the first, though it looked
ridiculously like an Egyptian mummy case. The inner bags

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
were just like those of the first sleeping bag, but as there was
no more rubber sheeting in town we had to make the outer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
bag of enameled cloth, such as is used for carriage curtains.
Out of this cloth Bill cut a piece of the shape shown in Fig.
200 to serve as bottom, sides and ends of the sleeping bag.
The bag was sewed wrong side
out; that is, the piece was laid
with enameled side up, and then the corners were sewed
together after painting the seams with white lead. Then a

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
top piece was cut out, of the size indicated in Fig. 201. The
edges were hemmed over a piece of rope, which thus formed
a corded edge. Now, with the enameled side of the cover
piece turned inward, its edges were sewed to the edges of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
first piece. The bag was now turned inside out, so that the
enameled surface lay on the outside and the seams turned inward.

<p>It was Bill&#8217;s idea to rig up the flap in such a manner that
it would not lie against the face,
so that the sleeper could
have plenty of fresh air,
even in rainy weather. This required the use of two headboards,
of the form shown in Fig. 202. The headboards
were connected at the bottom by a thin board, and to this
framework the sides of the bag were nailed. To the end

<span class='image-caption'>

flap several cleats were nailed, adapted to fit into notches
cut in the headboards. The cleat at the end of the flap was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
laid on edge, as shown, and fitted into deep notches in the
headboards just above the edge of the cover piece. This held
the flap securely, preventing it from flying open in a heavy
wind. At the same time the small space between the flap
and the cover piece allowed for an ample supply of fresh air.
When using this sleeping bag, if there was any indication of
a shower, we took care to have the head pointed to windward
so as to prevent entrance of rain through this air space.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>In connection with the sleeping bags it may be well to describe
here a curious shelter Dutchy and I came across in one
of our tramps. It was just about dusk one day when we discovered
a temporary camp at which a couple of men were
preparing dinner. They informed us that they were naturalists
on a two weeks&#8217; outing. At their invitation we joined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
camp with them. They had a small &#8220;A&#8221; tent of balloon silk,
under which they kept their provisions. The tent had no
ridge pole, but was supported instead by a rope stretched
between two trees (see Fig. 205).</p>

<p class='center caption'>

</p>
</div>

<p>The camp was also
furnished with an easy
canvas chair, made by
driving a couple of short
posts in the ground for
front legs and a pair of
longer ones for the back. A piece of canvas was hung over
these posts, forming both seat and back. The posts were
driven into the ground on a slant, as illustrated in Fig. 206,
and the canvas was formed
with pockets at the corners
which were hooked over these

posts. This made a very comfortable
chair, though, of
course, it was fixed to one spot.
When the men moved camp
they would carry with them
only the canvas piece, and at the next stopping place new
posts were chopped and used for legs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>But what interested us most was the form of bed they had.
This, like the chair, consisted of a piece of canvas arranged
to be supported on posts cut from the woods in the neighborhood
of the camp. The canvas piece was 3 feet wide and 6
feet long, with a wide hem at each side, forming pockets
through which poles were passed, as in a stretcher. The
ends of the poles were supported on posts driven into the
ground. The poles were also propped up at the center, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
shown, the pockets being cut away and bound, so as not to
permit any wear on the canvas. To prevent the posts from
leaning inward under the
weight of the sleeper,
they were braced apart by
cross sticks.</p>

a perfect protection against rain. The
ponchos these men had were not quite
long enough to cover the whole bed, so
they fastened umbrellas to the head
posts, as shown in Fig. 212. During a shower in the woods
the rain comes straight down in large drops, caused by the
water collecting on the leaves. To prevent these large drops
from splashing through the umbrellas, they laid pieces of
cloth over the umbrellas, which served, like the fly of a tent,
to check the fall of rain drops.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Nightmare.</p>

<p>I slept in the mummy case that night and Dutchy in the
first sleeping bag. It must have been about midnight when I
was awakened by a most unearthly yell. It sent the cold chills
running up and down my back. A second scream brought me
into action, and I struggled to throw back the head flap,
which had become caught. It seemed an age before I could
open it and wriggle out of the bag. Dutchy was sitting up
in bed with a look of horror on his face, and his whole body
was in a tremor of fear. One of the men dashed a glass of
water in his face, which brought him back to his senses. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
was only a nightmare, we found. Dutchy dreamed he had
been injured in a railway accident and had been taken for
dead to the morgue. He tried to let them know that he was
alive, but couldn&#8217;t utter a sound, until finally he burst out with
the yells that roused the camp. Then, as he awoke with the
horror of the dream still on him, his eyes fell on the two
stretcher beds that looked like biers and the black coffin-like
sleeping bag. It was not much wonder that Dutchy was
frightened. The camp did certainly have a most ghastly
appearance in the vague moonlight that filtered through the
trees, and it must have been still more gruesome to see the
coffin and biers suddenly burst open and the corpses come
running toward him. To prevent any further nightmare we
set Dutchy&#8217;s sleeping bag under the &#8220;A&#8221; tent, where he would
be saved the horror of again waking up in a morgue.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Pack Harness.</p>

<p>In the morning our friends broke camp and started westward.
Dutchy and I watched them packing up their goods
into a couple of very compact bundles, which they strapped to
their backs with a peculiar pack harness. I took careful note

</span>
of the way the harness was put together, and when we returned
to the island we made two sets for use on our tramping
expeditions. A canvas yoke was first cut out to the form
shown in Fig. 213. We used two thicknesses of the heaviest
brown canvas we could find, binding the two pieces together
with tape. The yoke was padded with cotton at the shoulders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
and a strap was
fastened to each
shoulder piece.
These were arranged
to be buckled
to a pair of straps
fastened to the back
of the yoke and
passing under the
arms. Riveted to
these straps were a
pair of straps used for fastening on the pack. The yoke
straps were attached with the rough side against the yoke,
while the pack straps were riveted on with the rough side
uppermost, as indicated in the drawing.</p>

<p>The method of riveting together
the leather straps may
need a word of explanation. A
copper rivet was passed through
a hole in the two straps; then the
washer was slipped over the projecting
end of the rivet. This washer had to be jammed
down tight against the leather, and to do this we drilled a
hole of the diameter of the rivet in a block of wood, and putting
this block over the washer, with the end of the rivet projecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
into the hole, we hammered the block until the washer
was forced down tight against the leather. Then taking a
light tack hammer we battered down the end of the rivet
onto the washer. Care was taken to do this hammering
very lightly, otherwise the end would have been bent over
instead of being flattened.</p>

<p>Only one thing of importance occurred between our
Christmas holidays and Eastertide: this was Bill&#8217;s invention
of the tricycle sailboat or land yacht. We had returned to
school with sailing on the brain. Our skate sail served us
well enough while there was any ice, but as spring came on
we wished we had our canoe with us, or even the old scow
to sail on the lakes near the school. Once we seriously considered
building a sailboat, but the project was given up,
as we had few facilities for such work. But Bill wasn&#8217;t
easily baffled, and I wasn&#8217;t surprised to have him come tearing
into the room one day, yelling, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it! I&#8217;ve got
it!&#8221; In his hands were two bicycle wheels, which I recognized
as belonging to a couple of bicycles we had discarded

to the shed at the
back of the school
and found that he
had already procured a couple of scantlings for the frame
of the boat. The sticks were 2 inches thick and 4 inches
wide. The backbone was cut to a length of 10 feet, and a
5-foot link was sawed off for the crosspiece. The two
pieces were securely nailed together about 3 feet from the
forward end of the backbone. The crosspiece was set on
edge, but a notch was cut in it about 1 inch deep to receive
the backbone. We might have braced the frame with
wooden braces, as in the ice boat, but we thought that this
time we would vary the design by using wire bracing instead,
thus making the frame much lighter. I asked Bill how he
proposed to tighten the wire. Turnbuckles were the thing,
but I knew that they were rather expensive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you leave that to me,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a scheme
that I think will work out all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the hardware store
of the town we bought
a pound of No. 16 iron

wire, eight large screw eyes and six eye bolts, with nuts and
washers. Both the screw eyes and eye bolts had welded eyes
and the shanks of the eye bolts were 6 inches long. A pair of
screw eyes were now threaded into the backbone at each side
about 18 inches from the end, and at each end of the crosspieces
an eye bolt was fastened. I began to see Bill&#8217;s plan.
He was going to draw the wire taut by tightening up the nuts
on the eye bolts. To get the best effect the hole for the eye
bolt had to be drilled in on a slant, so that the bolt would
pull directly in the line of
the wire. To get just
the right angle we ran a

cord from the screw eye
on one side to the point
where the bolt was to be
inserted, and traced its
direction on the crosspiece.
The hole for the
eye bolt was now drilled parallel with the mark we had traced.
The same was done at the other end of the crosspiece. A
pair of screw eyes were now screwed into the backbone at
the fore end and a pair of eye bolts were set at a corresponding
angle in the ends of the crosspiece. The crosspiece was
notched at each side so that the nuts and washers on the eye
bolts would have a square seating. Then we stretched
on the wire guy lines, drawing them as tight as possible,
with the eye bolts held in place by a turn or two of the nuts,
after which we screwed up the nuts as far as we could, thus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
drawing up the wire until it was very taut. This done the
second nut was threaded onto each bolt against the first so
as to lock it in place and prevent it from jarring loose.</p>

<p>Our next

We found in
the shed an old flagstaff 15
feet long and 3 inches in
diameter. The lower end of this,
for about a foot, we whittled down to a diameter of 2 inches,
and drove it into a hole in the backbone 12 inches from the
forward end. The mast was stayed by a wire stretched
from the head to an eye bolt at the fore end of the backbone.
The end of the mast which projected below the backbone
was stayed with wire running forward to an eye bolt and aft
to a screw eye on the backbone, and also with a pair of wires
running to screw eyes threaded into the crosspiece near the
ends. We couldn&#8217;t very well use eye bolts on these wires
except at the fore end, but we stretched the wires as tight
as possible before the screw eyes were screwed all the way in,
and then, as we turned the screw eyes, the wire was wound up
on them and drawn fairly taut. Fig. 219 shows a side view
of the frame, and wires marked 1 and 2 are the same as
illustrated in Fig. 218, which is a top or plan view of the

This was a triangular or
&#8220;leg-of-mutton&#8221; affair,
of the dimensions
given in Fig.
222. It was
made of light canvas, 30 inches
wide, of which we bought 14 yards.
Out of this we took one strip 18
feet long, one 13 feet, one 8 feet,
and one 3 feet long. We had no
sewing machine, and therefore had
to sew the strips together
by hand. The selvedge edges of the strips
were lapped over each other about an inch
and then they were sewed together sailor
fashion, that is, each edge was
hemmed down, as shown in Fig.
223. The strips were sewed together
so that at the foot each
projected at least 21 inches
below the next shorter
one. This done, the sail
was cut to the dimensions
given, allowing 1-1/2
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
inches all around for the hem. The hem was turned over
a light rope, forming a strong corded edge. At the clew,
tack and head loops were formed in the rope which projected
from the canvas, and at intervals
along the foot the canvas was cut
away, exposing the rope so that the sail
could be laced to the boom, as illustrated.

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>Our land yacht proved to be quite a successful craft in the
flat country around the school. Of course, we could not
sail everywhere; a country road is too narrow for any tacking
when it comes to sailing against the wind. We hadn&#8217;t
thought of that when we made our trial trip. A strong east
wind was blowing and so we ventured forth on a road that
led due west from our school. Off we sped before the wind
for two miles, until we came to a sharp turn in the road.
Then we began to think of turning homeward. But this
was a very different proposition. The wind was dead against
us and to try to tack from side to side of the road was useless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
because we would hardly get under way on one tack before
we had to swing around on the other tack, losing all our
momentum. It ended up by our lowering sail and ignominiously
trundling the yacht back to school. After that we
carefully selected our course, and never sailed away from
home before the wind unless we knew of a roundabout way
that would lead us back to port on a couple of reaches (long
tacks).</p>

<p>Just before Easter that year Bill&#8217;s Aunt Dorothy invited
him to spend Eastertide with her and bring along his roommate.
I accepted the invitation with alacrity. Bill had once
spent a whole summer at his aunt&#8217;s home, and when we
arrived there he had many old haunts to visit. We spent the
first day rambling through the woods, in the hills and back
of the house.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Bill&#8217;s Cave.</p>

<p>He introduced me to a cave which he believed was known
to only two other boys, both of whom had since moved to
New York city. The mouth of the cave was almost closed
by a large boulder that had lodged in front of it. We had
to climb to the top of this rock, and then letting ourselves
down with a rope we slid down the sloping rear face of the
boulder into a crevice in the rocks. Then after squirming
under a ledge we emerged into a large chamber, which appeared
to be as dark as night after our sudden entrance from
the outer light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>Bill lighted a candle which projected from a chink in the
wall. By its light I saw that there was a pool in the center
of the cave fed from a spring at one point. From the pool
the water trickled off into a tiny stream to the mouth of the
cave, where it was lost in a crack in the rocks. The water
was ice cold and clear as crystal. Around the pool were
several chairs and a table made by Bill and his two friends.
That was evidently where Bill had gotten his idea of a subterranean
club.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>Hanging between a couple of projecting rocks was a hammock
made of barrel staves. The hammock was a very
simple affair, made by drilling a 1-inch hole in each end of
each barrel stave. The staves were then connected by two
ropes on each side, woven alternately in and out through
these holes, that is, one rope would be passed down through

fine armchair, made from a
barrel that had been sawed off, as

back. The barrel was raised
from the ground by setting it on
a couple of boards arranged in
the form of a V. Then a caster
was fastened to the point of the
V and another at each end, making
a three-legged chair of it.
The chair was upholstered with ticking stuffed with straw.
First a piece of ticking large enough for the back was laid
on the ground and covered over with an even layer of straw.

This was nailed to the chair
back along the edge and at the
bottom, drawing the cloth as
taut as possible. To make
a better finish for the chair,
the ticking was covered with
dark red denim. Then strips

another one to run around the
chair just below the seat, also a
couple of small sandwiches to
cover the legs and the brackets
leading to them. These were all covered with denim before

Dorothy hung about the
bottom of the chair. A
thick, round sandwich was
now made to cover the seat
board. This was also given
a padded effect by binding
it with tape. The seat
board was not nailed to the

<p>Bill informed
me that he and
his two chums
used to spend
hot summer afternoons
in this cool
place whittling
out various ornaments
and making
furniture for the cave. In one corner were a number
of home-made amusement devices, one of which struck me
as rather odd. It consisted of a pair of large barrel staves,
hollow side up and connected with two short boards, as in
Fig. 233. Bill said it was a summer toboggan, to be used on
grass instead of snow. I had never heard of such an affair,
and, of course, had to have a demonstration. Bill went
to the top of the hill and from there coasted down the
grassy slope in fine style.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Tailless Kites.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a better place over on the other side of the
hill,&#8221; he said, and led the way to his favorite coasting spot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
But here our attention was diverted from coasting by the
curious sight of a full-grown man flying a kite. We found
out afterward that he was a Professor Keeler, who had made
a great scientific study of kites. Professor Keeler was very
affable, and we soon got acquainted with him. His kite
was way up in the air, almost out of sight, and was pulling
like everything. Neither Bill nor I could hold it long.
But the most remarkable part of it all to me was the fact that
the kite had no tail. I had heard of tailless kites made like
a box, but this one appeared to be very much like the kites I
had made in my younger days, and I well knew the importance
of a long tail to keep such a kite steady. We asked
the professor about it, and were informed that this kite was
of the Malay type, which is so designed that the cloth bellies
out into pockets on each side of the central stick or backbone,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
and these pockets balance the kite while the backbone
acts as a rudder.</p>

<p>Finding that we were interested in the subject he gave
us full instructions for making kites from 5 to 8 feet long,
and these I jotted down for future use. In a 5-foot kite
he said the stick should be 3/8 inch thick and 1/2 inch wide, in
a 6-foot kite 7/16 inch thick and 9/16 inch wide, in a 7-foot
kite 5/8 inch thick and 3/4 inch wide, and in an 8-foot kite
3/4 inch thick and 1 inch wide. On the following summer we
built a 5-footer and also an 8-footer.</p>

to directions, one stick was laid across the other at a point two-elevenths
of its length from the top. Two-elevenths of 5 feet
is a little less than 11 inches, and so we fastened on the

The sticks were not nailed together, because this would have
weakened the frame just at the point where it was under
the greatest strain. Instead we followed the professor&#8217;s
directions and tied cleats to each stick, as shown in Fig. 235,
so as to form sockets. Then the sticks were laid across
each other, each stick fitting into the socket of the other, just
like a mortised joint. A coat of shellac on the bottom of
each cleat glued it temporarily to the stick, after which it
was very tightly bound with fine cord. The stick and cleats
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>

Keeler told us to tighten this

equal to one-tenth of the length of the

fastened to the cross stick by flattening the ends and running
them under the cord used for binding on the cleats (see Fig.

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>An important change was made in the belly band of the
kite. The lower strand was made elastic by tying it fast
to a number of heavy rubber bands, as in Fig. 242. When
flying the kite, if a sudden, strong puff of wind struck it, the
elastic belly band would give, tilting up the lower end of the
kite so that the wind passed under; but as soon as the gust
had passed the rubber bands would draw the lower end of
the kite back against the wind. The elastic belly band had
the effect of making the kite rise almost vertically. Sometimes
it would even sail square overhead. The 8-foot kite
was a very powerful one. To hold it we had to use a very
strong cord, the kind used by upholsterers for tying down
the springs in a chair or a sofa.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Putting the Kites to Work.</p>

<p>Bill tested the strength of the kite once by hooking a
spring scale to the kite string. The scale was made to
register weights up to 25 pounds. But our kite yanked the
pointer immediately past the 25-pound mark as far as it
would go. We judged from this that the kite would lift
at least 40 pounds. Such a pull as this it seemed a pity to
waste, but how to utilize the power was a problem until one
day, when the kite was soaring up on a south wind, Dutchy
suggested that we tie it to one of the canoes and go sailing up-stream.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
We tried the trick at once, but it didn&#8217;t work very
well, because the canoe was too light. The kite would drop
unless there was a heavy pull on the string. We had better
success with the scow, however, which provided a sufficient
drag on the kite, and with the two kites to pull us we sailed
a long ways up-stream, drifting down with the current when
we had gone as far as we cared to.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WATER WHEEL.</span></h2>

<p>Summer found us again on Willow Clump Island with
heads full of new ideas. Bill had come across an old copy
of Ewbanks&#8217; &#8220;Hydraulics&#8221; in the school library. It was a
book describing machines of the ancients&#8211;principally devices
for raising water. Rather dry reading, I thought, even
though it was a wet subject; but Bill seemed to find it absorbingly
interesting. I came in late one afternoon, after a
glorious game of baseball, only to find Bill poring over the
yellowed leaves of the &#8220;Hydraulics&#8221; as fascinated as most
fellows would be over a detective story. It exasperated me
to note that he thought more of this old book than he did of
our baseball team.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;what&#8217;s got into you? I can&#8217;t for
the life of me see what is so entertaining in that prehistoric
book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go way. Don&#8217;t bother me,&#8221; was the surly reply.</p>

<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t be put off that way. Quickly I snatched the
book from his grasp and threw it out the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;maybe you will kindly explain to
me why you persist in studying that old volume, to the neglect
of our baseball team.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get so excited, old chap,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;That book
is all right. I&#8217;m studying up some new schemes for next
year&#8217;s expedition to Willow Clump Island. Why, there are
lots of things in that old book that we can make.&#8221; And he
proceeded to unfold his plans, sketching out some curious
designs of water wheels and pumps.</p>

<p>By the time school closed for the summer Bill had thoroughly
digested that volume, and was ready to reconstruct
many of the ancient machines.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Water Wheel.</p>

<p>Our first work on reaching the island was to erect a water
wheel, or &#8220;noria,&#8221; as it was called in the book, in front of
the camp. It had been a great nuisance to keep our filter
barrel full. Every few days we would have to form a
bucket brigade, passing pails of water up the line until the
barrel was filled. Now Bill proposed to do away with all
this bother and let the river do the work for us.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Surveying for the Water Wheel.</p>

<p>We first determined the height of the upper filter barrel
above the level of the river. This was done with our surveying
instrument, which was set level with the top of the
barrel. We sighted with the instrument to a long pole that
was held upright at the edge of the water. The pole had
been marked off into feet with white chalk marks, and on
sighting through the sight holes we found that the hairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
came in line with the eleventh chalk mark. The top of the
filter was, therefore, 11 feet above the level of the river.
Bill figured that it would be necessary to construct a wheel
about 15 feet in diameter in order to raise the water to the
proper height.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>First
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
we built the towers to
support the wheel. One tower
was 16 feet high and the other
only 10 feet. The large tower
was made something like a
very tall and narrow saw-horse.
Two stout poles 17
feet long were flattened at
their upper ends and
nailed together, with the
ends projecting about a
foot, as shown in Fig.
251. At the bottom
these poles were
spaced 8 feet apart by a cross bar, and about 9-1/2 feet from
the bottom a pair of boards were nailed to opposite sides of
the pole to serve as supports for the axle of the water wheel.
Another pair of 17-foot poles was now similarly fastened
together and then the two pairs were spaced about 12 feet
apart and connected at the top and bottom with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
boards.</p>

<p class='center caption'>

</p>
</div>

<p>At the top two smooth
boards were used and
these were nailed to
the inner sides of the
projecting ends,
which were tapered
off. In this manner
a V-shaped
trough was
formed. The
boards were
firmly nailed together

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
at their meeting edges so as to prevent them from
warping apart. A diagonal brace at each corner made the
wedge-shaped tower very substantial. A number of cleats
nailed to one of the poles
provided a ladder by which
we could mount to the top
of the tower. The shorter
tower was a three-legged
affair, made of three
12-foot poles. At first two
of these were flattened and nailed
together at their upper ends, and
they were braced at the top and
bottom. The third leg was then
nailed in place and braced by cross
bars connecting it with the other
two poles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>We were now ready to
make the wheel. From
Lumberville four 1/2-inch
boards, each 3 inches wide
and 15 feet long, were procured;
also a bar of iron 3/4
of an inch in diameter and
2 feet long. At the center
of one of the boards a block
of wood 4 inches long and
4 inches in diameter was
nailed on for a hub. A
3/4-inch hole was
now drilled through
this hub and the
board. Holes were also drilled into the
other boards at their centers. Then they

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
were all strung onto the bar and
spaced like spokes at equal angles
apart. Bill had figured it out
some way that the ends of the
boards should be just about 5 feet 10-1/2 inches
apart. When the boards were all arranged we
nailed them together at the center, and connected
the ends with narrow tie boards, as
indicated in Fig. 256.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>Eight large
tomato cans were
now procured and
fastened to the
spokes at the ends
on the inner side, that
is, the side the hub was
nailed to. We couldn&#8217;t
very well nail on the cans,
so we punched two holes in
the side of each can and then secured them to the spokes by
passing bolts through these holes and the boards.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Then we cut sixteen paddles of the form
shown in Fig. 257. Eight of these were 12
inches long, and the rest measured 18 inches.
A slot 3 inches deep was cut in each paddle
of just the right width to slip over the tie
boards. The shorter paddles were fastened
on just back of the spokes, and the rest were
secured half-way between each spoke. The
paddles were braced by stretching a wire
from one to another all the way around the
wheel.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>Our next task was to nail
the receiving trough in
place on the higher
tower. We set up
the towers on land
and mounted the
wheel between them
with the axle resting
in the crotch of the
short tower and in a
deep notch cut in the
cross boards of the
larger one. The cans on the
wheel faced the larger tower,
but the hub at the center and
a block nailed to the larger
tower spaced the wheel far
enough out so that the cans did not strike the tower as they
revolved. We carefully measured the distance between the
spokes and the larger tower, and
then built a square trough of a
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i273'></a><img src='images/fig-259.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig 259. The Receiving Trough.
</span>
</span>
size to just fit into this space.
This trough was nailed across
the end of the V-shaped trough
on top of the tower, but a notch
was cut in the side so that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
water would pour from the square or receiving trough into
this V-shaped one. The square trough was about 8 feet
long and its sides were 12 inches high; but at the ends we
had to cut them down to a height of but 6 inches, so as to
permit the cans to pass without hitting them.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Setting Up the Towers.</p>

<p>Our filter was located nearly 20 feet from the end of the
river, and in order to get a good current of water to revolve
our wheel we had to place it about 15 feet from shore.
This necessitated building a trough line 35 feet long. Ten
feet of this line were already provided in the top of the tall
tower. This tower was now set up in place with the legs
firmly wedged into holes excavated in the bottom of the
river. The legs on the shore side were sunk a little deeper,
so as to tilt the trough slightly shoreward. The outer end
of the trough was about 12 feet above the level of the water.
We needed but one more tower to support the remainder of
the trough line. This tower was built like the first one, but
was much shorter, as it was erected on land and the level of
the trough at the top had to be 5 or 6 inches lower so as to
make the water flow. We connected the towers by another
V-shaped trough section. This we nailed to the under side
of the first trough and to the inside of the second trough.
The latter was then in the same way connected by a trough
section with the upper filter barrel. We now rigged up our
shorter tower about a foot from the taller one, wedging in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
the legs so that the top came level with the slotted boards
of the other tower.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Mounting the Water Wheel.</p>

<p>Then came the task of mounting our wheel in place. We
were working in a pretty strong current and found it no
easy matter. In the first place, the wheel was floated down to
the towers, but there it got jammed and we couldn&#8217;t lift it
up. One of the paddles was broken and a bucket wrenched
off before we could disentangle the wheel from the towers,
and then the wheel was carried quite a distance down-stream
before we could drag it in to shore.</p>

<p>Our next attempt was more successful. This time we
anchored the wheel so that it just cleared the towers, then
fastening a couple of long guy ropes to it, we raised the wheel
on edge, while a boy stood on each side holding the ropes to
keep the wheel steady. The anchor rope was now slowly
paid out and the wheel was rolled in between the towers.
This done, the wheel was lifted up and the axle rod was
pushed in, with the ends of the rod resting in slots of the
boards on the tall tower and in the crotch on the shorter
one. To prevent the axle rod from working endwise out
of its bearings, we nailed pieces of wood across the crotch
and the slots against the ends of the rod. Then we cast off
the anchor rope and our wheel started work, the cans dipping
up the water as they were carried around by the wheel
and pouring it out of the top into the receiving trough, from
which the water flowed down into the filter barrel.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>The trough line was very leaky and a great deal of water
splashed out of the buckets. But for all that, within a few
moments our barrel was full and overflowing. We hadn&#8217;t
figured on its filling so rapidly, but we soon found a way of
utilizing the surplus water. It was led to a half-barrel in
which we washed our dishes, and from there it flowed
through a ditch back to the river. The water for the wash
barrel was taken from the top of the upper filter barrel.
But we let the lower filter barrel flow over so that it would
be kept wet on the outside. Our filter was fortunately
placed at a point where a good breeze struck it, and we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
shoveled away the earth that had been piled around it so
that the wind playing on the wet barrel evaporated the
moisture, making the water inside very cool.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Canvas Bucket.</p>

<p>This same trick was used for cooling our drinking water
whenever we went off on an expedition away from camp.
We had a heavy canvas bucket, the kind used on ships. We
would fill this bucket with water and then hang it up in the
wind. The water seeping out of the pores of the bucket
would be evaporated by the wind, and this would, in a few
moments, make the water inside delightfully cool. Such
buckets may be bought for $1.50 to $2.00 apiece, but ours
was a home-made affair, and made somewhat differently from
the store kind. The canvas used was the heaviest we could
find. A piece 9 inches in diameter was cut out for the
<span class='image-right'>

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
bottom. A ring 7 inches in diameter, made of heavy brass
wire, was laid on the canvas, and the cloth was turned over
it and sewed down the inside of the ring. For the sides of
the bucket we cut a piece 14 inches wide and 23 inches long.
The upper edge was strengthened by a piece of light rope
held in place by hemming the cloth over it. The lower edge
was now sewed to the bottom,
just inside the wire ring and
then the ends of the piece were
joined, completing the sides
of the bucket. The bail of the
bucket was formed of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
piece of rope fastened to the roped upper edge of the
bucket.</p>

<p>But to return to the current wheel; the day after it was
completed, when I went over to Lumberville for the mail, I
was met by old Jim Halliday, who wanted to know what sort
of a rig we had out on the river. I told him, and after a dint
of much persuasion, induced him to take a ride back in the
scow with me. He had never visited our camp and hadn&#8217;t
realized how handy we were
with the tools, because, with
the exception of the current
wheel, all our work had been
done on the opposite side of
the island. We made him a
guest of honor, showing him
over the whole place. The
bridges struck him as remarkably
clever, but what pleased
him most was our current
wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ef that ain&#8217;t jest the thing I have
been awantin&#8217; for the past twenty year. What&#8217;ll ye sell
me the hull plant fer, boys?&#8221;</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Mr. Halliday&#8217;s Water Wheel.</p>

<p>We thought he was fooling at first, but when he had
assured us that he was in earnest, Bill told him that we
needed our own plant, but we could build him a similar
and even better current wheel for any amount he thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
it was worth to him. The figure settled on was six dollars
(a dollar apiece) for our work, Mr. Halliday paying for
the material. It was not a
large sum, but it seemed

</span>
</span>
a lot to us, and considering
the scarcity of
money in that region
it was pretty generous
pay. We built Mr.
Halliday&#8217;s current
wheel just like our
own, except that the paddles were much broader, and instead
of using cans for the buckets Mr. Halliday supplied us with
small dinner pails. The method of fastening on the pails
is shown in Fig. 263. A stick was nailed across the end of
each spoke and the bail of the pail was held by a screw eye
threaded into this stick. The pails would hang straight,
holding all the water without spilling a drop until the receiving
trough was reached. This trough was fastened high
enough to strike the bottom of the pails as they went by,
tipping them over and emptying them of their contents.
From the trough the water ran directly into a large cider
barrel and from here was carried through a pipe to Mr.
Halliday&#8217;s barn. A stopcock was here provided so that
he could turn the water on or off, as he desired. The use of
pails was a great improvement on tin can buckets. Fully
three times as much water was poured into the receiving
trough, because not a drop was spilled out on the way up.</p>

<p>Immediately after fitting out Jim Halliday with his
water wheel we set to work on our log cabin. As a model
we had a photograph of a log hut which Uncle Ed had sent
us. As the cabin was designed particularly for use in
winter time, we decided that it should be located where it
would be sheltered from the northern winds and would be
exposed to the sun. The ideal spot seemed to be on the
southern shore of Kite Island, which was backed by a thick
grove of trees but gave an unobstructed view in front for
a distance of about four miles down-stream.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Foundation of Log Cabin.</p>

<p>First we staked out the plan of the house. It was to be
12 feet long by 10 feet wide, so we leveled off a space of this
area, and at the corners, where the greatest weight of the
building would come, large rocks were embedded in the
ground.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>A Logging Expedition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>The logs for the house were cut from a tract of wooded
land about five miles up the river, belonging to Mr. Schreiner.
To be sure we could have cut the timber from our
own island, but when Reddy had said something to his father
about our building a log cabin, Mr. Schreiner had warned
us not to cut down any of the trees without the owner&#8217;s permission.
All we could learn about the owner was that his
name was Smith, and that he lived somewhere in New York
city. It seemed unlikely that he would ever have anything
to say about our cutting down a few trees, but rather
than run any risk Mr. Schreiner advised us to make use of
his woods for any timber we might need. Accordingly we
started out early one morning on a logging expedition. We
had no apparatus for handling any logs more than 6 or 8
inches in diameter, and Bill reckoned it out that we would
have to have about fifty logs of this size for the sides of the
building alone. This did not mean that fifty trees had
to be chopped down, because we could usually cut two logs
from a single tree. As the logs would have to overlap about
a foot at each corner, we had to cut the longer ones to a
length of 14 feet and the others to a length of 12 feet. Aside
from these we had to have several 16-foot logs for the roof.
Only the straightest logs were chosen, and while Bill and
Reddy wielded the axes the rest of us hacked off the small
branches with hatchets and hauled the sticks down the river.
Here we tied them together to make a raft.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Log Raft.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>This was done by running a pair of ropes alternately over
and under the logs at each end (see Fig. 264). About
fifteen were thus fastened together, and then as an extra precaution
a log was laid across each end of the raft and tied
fast. As soon as we had cut enough timber for our first
raft, we all ceased

work, to take a ride
down the river on
the logs. Two of us,
armed with poles,
were to do the steering.
There was one
spot in the river of which
we were rather apprehensive.
That was a bit of shallow, swift water three miles
from camp. A line of rocks jutted up from the river, forming
a natural dam which was broken only at the eastern end.
The water swirled madly through this opening, and veering
off a huge rock which lay directly in front of the gap turned
sharply westward. As we neared this dam the river became
deeper and deeper, until finally we could no longer reach
bottom with the poles, and could not properly steer the boat.
For some time we drifted helplessly round and round in the
still water above the dam. Then suddenly the current
caught us and we swept like a shot for the opening. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
gap was quite wide, and had we only thought to provide
ourselves with oars we could have steered the raft clear of
the rocks below, but we were entirely at the mercy of the
current, and with a terrific crash we were hurled head on
against the boulder.</p>

<p>Just what happened then I can not say. When I undertook
to record the incident in the chronicles of the S. S. I.
E. E. of W. C. I., I found there were five entirely different
versions of the affair besides my own. I knew that immediately
after the shock I found myself struggling in the
water just below the rock over which I must have been slung
by the force of the impact. Dutchy declared up and down
that he had sailed fifty feet in the air astride of a log. Bill
had been almost stunned by a blow on the head and was
clinging desperately to a jagged projection of the rock. The
ropes that had held the raft together had parted, scattering
the logs in all directions, and I could see the rest of the crew
hanging on to them for dear life.</p>

<p>Shouting to Bill to let go his hold on the rock. I swam over
and caught him as he drifted down, then I helped him ashore.
Leaving Bill to recuperate I rushed down the bank, shouting
to the others to paddle the logs over toward shore. Then
I plunged in, and pulling myself up on the nearest log, paddled
shoreward as we had done on the planks when shooting
the rapids. In this way one by one we corralled the logs,
and after tying them together again resumed our voyage
down the river. We now had no swift water to fear and were
able to guide the raft successfully down to Lake Placid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
But here we moored it, not venturing to take it past the mill-race
until we had gotten the oars from the scow and nailed
on oar locks at each side and the rear, so that we could properly
row and steer the raft safely to Kite Island.</p>

<p>When we went up the river again we carried the oars
with us, also the sail and mast belonging to our ice boat, as
there was a good breeze blowing down-stream. Our second
trip was more successful. The mast was stepped in a small
but solid box nailed to the logs. In the top of this box a
hole was cut for the mast to fit
into and then the mast was
braced with guy lines. We
came down the river in fine
style, steering straight
for the opening in the
dam, and just as we
were about to shoot
through Reddy
and I plied the
oars for all we
were worth on
the port (left)
side so as to
swing the raft
around past the
boulder. However,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
we didn&#8217;t escape entirely without accident, for the raft rode
up on a submerged ledge, dipping the starboard side clear
under water and nearly tipping us over. But in a moment
the raft had righted itself and we had smooth sailing for the
rest of the way.</p>

Fig. 266. Foundation Logs Notched.
</p>
</div>

<p>Our third expedition completed the number of logs we
required for the log cabin. Two large 12-foot logs were
chosen for the foundation logs at the front and rear of the
building. The logs were flattened along the bottom so that
they would have a firmer bearing on the ground, and particularly
on the corners, where they rested on foundation stones.
Each log was now notched about a foot from the ends. The
notches were 8 inches long and about 2 inches deep. Care
was taken to place those on one log squarely opposite the
notches on the other. A pair of 14-foot logs were now laid
across the foundation logs and rolled along them until another
half-turn would have dropped them into the notches
(shown in Fig. 266). Then notches were cut in the 14-foot
logs to correspond, so that when the final half-turn was
given one notch would fit over
the other, making a mortise
joint (Fig. 267).
When the side
logs were in
position
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
notches were cut in their upper surface to receive a pair of
12-foot logs which were rolled onto them, notched and
dropped into place. Then another pair of side logs were
laid on, and so the work progressed.
The notches in
each log were cut to
a depth equal
<span class='image-right'>

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
to one-quarter
the diameter of
the log; that
is, if the log was 8 inches in diameter the notch was made 2
inches deep, and if 6 inches in diameter it was cut to a depth
of 1-1/2 inches. When the logs were laid in place no space
intervened between them, as will be clearly understood by
reference to Fig. 268.</p>

<p>We found, after a few logs had been set in place, that our
cabin was growing faster at one end than at the other. The
trouble was that our logs were not of uniform diameter
throughout, and we had been laying the butt ends, which
were larger, all at
one end of the
building. So we
had to take down
the logs and relay

them with the butt
end of the front
foundation log at
one end and that of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
the rear foundation log at the other. Then the cross logs
were laid on with their butt ends on the small ends of the
foundation logs. The next end logs were laid with their
small ends on the butt ends of the cross logs, and so on, taking
care never to lay the butt end of one log across the butt end
of another. In this way the walls were built up evenly to a
height of 3 feet.</p>

Fig. 269. Piece Cut Out to Admit Saw.
</p>
</div>

<p>We had planned to make a large open fireplace in the
cabin, and this necessitated cutting an opening in the rear
wall. But we did not want to cut the opening until the wall
was built up to its full height lest it might buckle while the
remainder of the logs were being placed in position. So
we merely cut a piece out of the top log to make room for a
saw when we were ready to cut the complete opening. As
our fireplace was to be 5 feet in width, a 5-foot piece was cut
out of the center of the log. Then the ends were supported
by cleats nailed on each side, as shown in Fig. 269. This
done the building was continued as before, but as the walls
grew we found it more and more difficult to raise the logs to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
position. We could not lift them directly to the top of the
wall, but had to roll them up on &#8220;skids&#8221;; that is, on a pair
of 14-foot logs which were laid against the top of the wall.
When the walls had reached a height of about 5 feet above
the foundation logs, a length 4 feet 9 inches long was cut
out of the top log to allow space for sawing out the front
door and window, and also a 30-inch piece was cut out for the
side window. Cleats temporarily held the sawed ends of
the logs, while the walls were
carried on up to a height of a
little over 6 feet from
the foundation logs.</p>

<p class='center caption'>
Fig. 270. Skids
</p>
</div>

<p>Then we started laying the roof. A 16-foot log was now
notched in place at each side, with its forward end projecting
about 3 feet over the front of the cabin to form a shelter in
front of the building. A pair of 12-foot logs were then laid
in position. The next pair of 16-foot logs were laid about
20 inches in from the sides, and after a pair of the cross logs
had been set in place a third pair of logs were laid about
40 inches from the sides. Finally, a single 16-foot log was
set in place at the center, to serve as the ridge beam of the
roof. The roof logs were all carefully tested to see if they
were sound before we laid them in place, because we did not
want to run any risk of the roof falling in, particularly in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
winter time, when it would be heavily covered with snow.
A chalk line was drawn from the ridge beam to the lower
roof beam, and the cross logs were sawed off along this line,
as indicated in Fig. 271. Several slabs were now procured
and laid across the roof beams to serve as rafters. These
rafters projected about 18 inches beyond the side walls of
the cabin, so as to support the eaves. Over the rafters we
laid a roofing of slabs, starting with the bottom and lapping
them, as we had done on our tree house.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Door and Window Frames.</p>

<p>We were now ready to cut out and frame the doors and
window openings. The front window of the cabin was to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
close beside the door, so we merely widened the door opening
at the top to include the window opening as well (see Figs.
271 and 272). The door was made 2-1/2 feet wide, and was
cut down to the foundation logs. The window opening was
cut to a depth of 24 inches. Before sawing out the opening
we wedged pieces of wood between the logs along the line
we were to follow with the saw, so as to keep them in
place. After the opening had been made a couple of stout
boards were nailed to the sawed ends of the logs at each
side, to hold them securely in place and make a suitable framing
for the door. The cleats were then removed. The
foundation log and the one at the top of the opening were
flattened, to serve as the sill and lintel of the door. Between
the door and window a short post was wedged in place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
This post was flattened on opposite sides, so that the door
jamb could be nailed against it on one side and the window
frame on the other. The side window was next cut out
and framed. After it had been framed it measured 2 feet
square.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Fireplace.</p>

<p>Then came the task of building our fireplace. First we
sawed out the opening, cutting right through the rear foundation
log. Then we gathered from the river a large number
of the flattest stones we could find. With these we planned
to build the three outer walls of our chimney. But the question
of getting mortar to bind the stones together bothered
us for a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only we could find a bed of clay. Don&#8217;t any of you
know of one around here?&#8221; queried Bill.</p>

<p>But none of us remembered seeing any clay bed in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were in south Jersey now,&#8221; I said, &#8220;we could
use some of that red mud they have down there. It sticks
like the mischief to shoes and pant legs. I bet it would hold
those stones together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Red mud? Why there&#8217;s plenty of it over the hill, back
of Lumberville,&#8221; said Reddy. &#8220;All the roads over there are
red shale roads, and I saw some red banks along the river
when we went after the logs.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was just what we wanted. The banks Reddy referred
to turned out to be genuine red shale, and soon we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
ferried several scow loads of the stuff down to Kite Island.
When the shale was wet it made quite a sticky mortar. The
foundations of the chimney were laid in a trench about 2 feet
deep, and the side walls of the chimney were carried inside
of the cabin and covered the ends of the logs at the chimney
opening. The side walls extended outward a distance of
3 feet, where they were joined by the rear wall of the
chimney.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Proper Way to Build a Stone Wall.</p>

<p>In making our chimney we could not rely on the red shale
to hold the stones as firmly as good lime mortar would, so
we had to be careful that each stone, as it was laid, had a
firm bearing. The stones were embedded in a thick layer
of mud, and if they showed any tendency to teeter we
propped them up by wedging small stones under them until
they lay solid. Another thing that we were very careful
about was to &#8220;break joints&#8221;; that is, to keep the joints in
each layer of the stones from coinciding with those in the
next layer, above or below. To make sure of this we made
it a point to lay a stone over each joint in the top of the wall
and then to fill in the space between the stones with smaller
stones. In this way the wall was made very substantial.</p>

<p>When the masonry had been carried up to the top of the
chimney opening, a heavy timber about 12 inches wide was
laid across the walls close against the wall of the building.
This was to support the fourth wall of the chimney, and so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
we flattened its upper surface. To prevent it from catching
fire it was covered with a thick plastering of mud, and then
to keep the mud from cracking and flaking off we procured

</span>
a piece of tin and
tacked it over the
log. The tin also
extended over the
top log of the
opening. Then
we went on with
the building of the chimney walls, carrying them up about a
foot above the ridge of the roof. Our chimney was completed
by paving the bottom with stones, well packed in mud
and nicely smoothed off to make the hearth. The hearth
extended about 18 inches into the cabin, and was framed with
logs, as shown in Fig. 275.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Floor of the Cabin.</p>

<p>A number of logs were now laid on the ground to serve as
floor beams. Slabs were used for the floor. We had some
trouble in making the floor perfectly even, because the floor
beams were rather irregular, and a great deal of time was
spent in smoothing the logs off to a common level. If we had
the work to do over again we would have bought two or
three planks and laid them on edge to support the flooring.</p>

sticks of wood were then whittled to fit snugly, but without
jamming, into these holes. These sticks were then nailed to
the inner face of the door, with their whittled ends projecting
into the holes, forming
pintles on which the
door could turn. A narrow
strip of wood was
nailed to the outer jamb
for the door to close
against. The latch consisted
of a stick of wood,
fastened to the door at
one end with a nail. It
hooked onto a catch
whittled out of hard
wood to the form illustrated in Fig. 278, and nailed to the

<p>For our windows we made wooden sashes which fitted

in these holes held the sash in place, and served also
as hinge pins for the sash to turn on. The sash could be

<p>Our next work was directed
toward providing sleeping
accommodations in the log

cabin. A large log was laid on the floor the full length of the
cabin, as far out as possible without interfering with the
opening of the front
door. Stakes were laid
across this log, with their
opposite ends wedged in
between the logs of the
wall. A nail or two in
each slab held it in place.
This formed a sort of
shelf 12 feet long, which
was divided at the center
to form two bunks, each wide enough for two persons. But
as there were six of us in the society, we had to provide two
more berths. A stout post was set into a hole in the ground,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
and nailed firmly at the bottom to the lower berth log and
at the top to one of the roof beams. This post supported a
second berth log, which extended the full length of the building
at a height of about 3 feet from the floor, and was
wedged at the ends between the logs of the house. Cleats
were nailed to the walls under this berth log to make it
perfectly secure. Then slabs were nailed across it to form
the two bunks.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Stopping up the Chinks.</p>

<p>When our log cabin was completed we immediately
transferred our camp from the tent to the hut. But at the
very outset we were confronted with the problem of getting
drinking water. We hadn&#8217;t thought of that before. It was
easy enough to move the filter barrels, but when it came to
moving the water wheel we could find no suitable place for it
anywhere near the log cabin. The water of Lake Placid was
too quiet, while the mill-race and the rapids on the other side
of Kite Island ran so swiftly that we were afraid the water
wheel would be swept away with its course. The matter
was carefully considered at a special meeting of the society.
It occurred to Bill that we might build a windmill in place
of the water wheel, and use it to pump water from a well
which could be dug near the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have to use a filter, then,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, because the sand of the island will strain out
all the dirt in the water. You see, the water in the well will
have to soak in from the river, and by the time it gets through
all the gravel and sand between the river and the well it
ought to be filtered pretty clear.&#8221;</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Digging the Well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>That sounded logical, and so we adopted the plan at once.
We chose a spot quite near the hut for our well. When we
had dug down about 6 feet we struck water, but continued
excavating until the water lay 3 feet deep in the well.
While making the excavation we shored up the sides with
planks, to prevent the loose soil from falling in on us and
smothering us, as it so nearly did when we were digging our
first cave. By &#8220;shoring,&#8221; I mean we lined the walls with
planks, which were driven into the ground with large wooden
mallets. The planks were braced apart with sticks at frequent
intervals. As the well hole grew deeper we had to
rig up a bucket to haul the dirt out. Our bucket was a soap
box attached to a rope, which
passed through a pulley at the

top of the well. The pulley
was supported by a tripod
made by firmly lashing
together the
upper ends of
three stout
poles and
spreading their
lower ends far
enough apart
to straddle the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
mouth of the well, as shown in Fig. 282. After the well
had been carried down to a sufficient depth, we began laying
the stone wall, which was to form the permanent lining. We
knew that the wooden walls would not do, because they would
soon decay. Our stone wall, which
was built up of flat stones like the
chimney of the log house, was not
very strong, I fear, and had not the
soil around it been pretty firm it
would probably have caved in.
However, if it served no other
purpose, it formed a fairly good
finish for the well.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The mouth of the well was
carefully covered with planks
while we constructed the windmill
above it. For the tower of
the windmill we chose four long
sticks. They must have measured
about 16 feet in length, and
were from 4 to 6 inches in diameter. With them we made
two frames of the form given in Fig. 283, using slabs to
brace them apart. These frames were now set in position,
with their lower ends firmly planted in holes in the ground,
and the tower was completed by nailing on a number of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
diagonal braces. A couple of boards were nailed across the
upper ends at opposite sides, and holes were drilled through
them to provide bearings for the wind wheel shaft.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Crank Shaft.</p>

<p>The shaft was a piece of heavy iron rod which we procured
from the blacksmith at Lumberville. Under Bill&#8217;s
direction the blacksmith hammered a U-shaped bend at the
center of the shaft, so as to form a crank, and then he flattened
the rod near the ends (see Fig. 284). When the shaft
was set in its place these flat spots lay just outside of the
bearing boards, and

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
then, to keep the
shaft from sliding
back and forth in its
bearings, we fastened
on two clamps
over these flattened parts. The clamps were made of pairs of
hardwood blocks bolted together in the manner indicated
in Fig. 285.</p>

the wind wheel. First
we procured three boards, each
3 inches wide and 3-1/2 feet
long. A 1/2-inch hole was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
drilled in the center of each
board, and then, with these
holes coinciding, the boards
were nailed together, with
their ends projecting, like
spokes, equally distant from
each other. Six wedges were
now made of the size indicated
in Fig. 286. These were made of a 2 x 4-inch scantling,

</span>
sawed diagonally in two and then planed down to the given
dimensions. The wedges were now nailed firmly to the spokes,
as shown in Fig. 286. For the blades we used six thin
boards, each about 4 feet
long. Each blade measured
10 inches in width
at the outer end, and
tapered down to a width
of 3 inches at the inner
end, as illustrated in Fig.
288. The blades were

</span>
now securely nailed to
the wedges, and their
outer ends were braced
together by means of
wires stretched from the forward edge of each blade to the
rear edge of the next one ahead. The wheel was then fitted
onto the shaft and nailed to one of the clamps. In this way
it was practically keyed to the shaft.</p>

<p>We did not make any vane for our windmill. It did not
need any. The wind nearly always blew either up or down
the river, more often up the river, for the prevailing summer
winds in that part of the country are southerly. But,

</span>
aside from that,
east and west
winds could not
very well reach us
on account of the hills on both sides of the river. The wheel
was set facing the north, because the strongest winds came
from that direction, and as an extra brace against these winds
we stretched wires from the projecting end of the shaft to the
center of each blade.</p>

<p>A brisk northerly

it began to revolve
at once, before we
could nail it to the

we nailed a stick of
wood to the tower,
so that its end projected
in the path of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>

<p>Our pump was made
of a galvanized leader
pipe; that is, a pipe used
to carry off rain water
from the roof of the
house. The pipe was
only about 8 feet long,
and so we had to piece it
out with a long wooden
box pipe. A block closed
the lower end of this
box, and the leader pipe
fitted snugly into a hole
in the block (Fig. 291). A spout was set into the upper end
of the box pipe to carry the water to the cask, which was to
serve as our water reservoir.</p>

This piston was fastened to a wooden rod long enough to
reach from well within the pipe to the wind wheel shaft.
A strip of brass was bent over the crank, or U-shaped

<p>It was rather a crude pump, but it
did all the work we required of it. As
the wheel went around the crank shaft
would move the piston up and down.
Whenever the piston went down, the air
in the pipe would press up the edges of
the leather disk and squeeze past (see Fig. 295). Then
when the piston came up again, the leather disk, being backed
by the wooden disk beneath it, was kept flat, so that no air
could force its way back into the pipe. This made a partial
vacuum in the pipe, and the water from the well rushed up
through the valve at the bottom to fill it (see Fig. 296).
When next the piston went down the bottom valve closed and
more air forced its way past the piston. Then on the next
upward stroke more water flowed into the pipe, until, after
a number of strokes, all the air was pumped out and the
water which took its place began to force its way up past
the piston and eventually to flow out of the spout into the
cask.</p>

<p>Our old windmill was sold to a farmer near Lumberville
when we broke camp that fall. We carted it over and set it
up for him. A number of years later I saw it still faithfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>

had been worn out and a new one substituted, but otherwise

<p>&#8220;About all we lack now,&#8221; said Dutchy, when the windmill
had been completed, &#8220;is a railroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then suppose we build one,&#8221; was Bill&#8217;s unexpected rejoinder.</p>

<p>We all thought he was joking, but he wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean a steam railroad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but a gravity
railroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gravity railroad. Oh, you know what that is&#8211;a
roller toboggan&#8211;the kind they have down at Coney Island.&#8221;
And he went on to explain how we could rig up a simple
roller toboggan on our island.</p>

<p>His plan was to build an inclined trestle on the high ground
just below the lagoon, and then run wooden tracks along the
shore down to the pontoon bridge, and across the mill-race
to Kite Island. We started first to dig a road down to the
bridge, because the bank was quite high at this point. The
task was rather greater than we anticipated, but we kept
steadily at it until we had cut a fairly good road through the
bank, though the grade was rather steep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>Before proceeding with the trestle and track we thought
the best plan would be to build our car, and then we could
use it as a gauge to determine how far apart the rails should
be set.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Car.</p>

<p>First we got a 2 x 4-inch scantling, and cut from it two
lengths, each 4 feet 6 inches long. These were laid on edge
just 30 inches apart, and then a number of boards were
nailed across from one
scantling to the
other and sawed
<span class='image-right'>

off flush with
their edges. The
floor thus formed
was now turned
over so that the
scantlings lay uppermost
and the sides of the car were then nailed on with
their edges overlapping the ends of the floor boards. The
sides, which were about 18 inches high, were each made of
two boards firmly battened together. Great care was taken to
securely nail both the flooring and the sides to the scantlings,
because these scantlings were to carry the wheels of the car.
The car body was completed by nailing on the end pieces
which overlapped both the flooring and the side walls.</p>

<p class='center caption'>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>Next we sawed out the wheels
of our car. From a board of
hardwood 3/4 of an inch thick
four disks, 12 inches in diameter,
were sawed out. Then from a
board 1 inch thick four 9-inch
disks were sawed out. We cut
these disks in the same way as we had made the disks for our
surveying rod (see page 78), by making cuts across corners
and finally smoothing off the angles with a draw-knife. A
half-inch hole was now drilled in the center of each disk.
Then on each large disk a smaller one was placed, with the
center holes of the two coinciding and the grain of one lying
across the grain of the other. In this position they were
firmly nailed together, making a wheel like those used on a
railway car, with the small disc forming the tread of the
wheel and the large disk serving as a flange.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Car Axles.</p>

<p>For the car axles we bought four 1/2-inch bolts, 6 inches
long, with two washers and two nuts for each bolt. In

</span>
each side of the car, about 8 inches from the ends, we nailed
face blocks; that is, blocks of wood for the wheels to bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
against. These face blocks were
only 1/2 inch thick. Then in
these blocks holes
were drilled which
were carried clear
through the scantling.
The holes
were just large
enough for the bolts
to fit snugly in
them. The bolts were inserted from the inside, so that their
threaded ends projected out at each side of the car. A patch
of wood was nailed to the scantling over each bolt head to
prevent the bolt from slipping back into the car. Then the
wheels were mounted on these
bolts, which served as axles.</p>

<p>First a washer was
placed on the axle,
then the wheel was applied,
with the larger
or flange disk against
the face block, after
which another washer
was slipped on. A nut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
was screwed against this washer just tightly enough to keep
the wheel snugly in place, and yet let it turn freely on its
axle. Then to keep this nut from shaking loose a second
nut was screwed on against it. While one fellow held the
first nut from turning, another screwed the second nut against
it as tightly as he could. The second nut is technically
known as a &#8220;jam nut,&#8221; or &#8220;lock nut.&#8221; The car was completed
by laying a couple of boards across from one scantling
to the other to serve as seats.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Railway Track.</p>

<p>The trestle was now begun. First we erected a level platform,
which was to be the starting point of the railway.
This was made very substantial by planting the corner posts

firmly in the ground and then bracing them together with
diagonal braces. A couple of planks leaning against the
platform at one side provided a convenient
means for mounting to the top. From
the platform the trestle ran down
at an easy incline to the
ground. It was made
of 2 x 4-inch
scantlings supported
at intervals
on posts
driven into the
ground. The opposite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
posts were firmly braced with boards fastened diagonally
across them. The scantlings were to serve as rails, and

so we fastened them at the proper distance apart with ties
nailed to the under side. But to be sure that the rails were
not too far apart or too close together, the car was rolled
over the track and the rails were
set to keep the tread disks of
the wheels on them
and the flange disks
just clear of their
inner edges. The
ends of the rails
were cut off at an angle, making a slanting joint, as shown in

nailing a piece of board on the bottom and also on the outer
side.</p>

<p>From the bottom of
the inclined trestleway
we continued the track
down the slope to the
river; but for the
sake of economy,
instead of using
2 x 4-inch scantlings
for the rails, we
bought a number of
2-inch planks at Lumberville,
and had them
sawed up into strips 2 inches wide. These 2-inch square
rails were fastened together with slabs nailed on at frequent
intervals. To maintain the proper gauge the car was rolled
over each pair of rails, which were nailed first at the ends
and center. To anchor the track we drove short posts into
the ground so that their upper ends lay flush with the surface.
A post was provided under each joint and one under the
center of each rail, and then the slab ties were nailed securely
to these posts. In imitation of a full-sized railway, we
made it a point to &#8220;break joints&#8221; on our track; that is, to
make the end of one rail come in line with the center of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
opposite rail, as shown in Fig. 302. Our track was continued
across the pontoon bridge and ran around the west
shore of Kite Island. The track was straight as far as the
shore of Kite Island, whence, by an easy curve, it was carried
around to the log cabin.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The First Railway Accident.</p>

<p>Dutchy was the first one to try the railway. He sneaked
back to the platform while the rest of us were putting a few
last touches on the track. The first we knew the car came
tearing down the track at full speed, with Dutchy yelling at
the top of his voice for us to get out of his way. Bill was
on the bridge when the car came along and he had no time
to run for shore, but with great presence of mind he jumped
into the water and clung to one of the barrels. But the
joke of it all was that Dutchy himself got a wetting too.
The track at the middle of the bridge was not quite true to
gauge. It was this very spot that Bill was fixing up when
Dutchy came along. The end of a rail was bent in far
enough to catch the flange of one of the car wheels, and in a
moment Dutchy, car and all, was slung head over heels
into the mill-race. Fortunately no serious harm was done.
Dutchy landed a little ways down-stream, and Reddy, by
quick work, managed to rescue the car just as it was floating
off under the suspension bridge. The car was undamaged
except that the flange of a wheel was split off.</p>

<p>Of course, Bill was as mad as a hornet at Dutchy, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
expressed his feelings in no mild terms. But his anger was
somewhat tempered by the fact that Dutchy received as bad
a punishment as he had inflicted.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Testing the Track.</p>

<p>We had to cut a new flange disk for the broken wheel,
and to prevent the flanges from splitting off again we nailed
a batten across the inner face of each wheel extending down
to the very edge of the flange disk. This batten was fastened
on across the grain. When everything was completed
the car was started down the track empty to see if it would
keep the rails. It went beautifully as far as the bridge, but
was too light to run much beyond. The next time we loaded
it up with stones and had the pleasure of watching it sail
down hill, across the bridge and vanish out of sight around
the shore of Kite Island. That was demonstration enough.
We knew it would carry us safely and it did. The next
time we tried it four of us piled into the small car, and in a
moment we were off on a most thrilling ride, which ended
right in front of the log cabin, where the car came to a

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CANTILEVER BRIDGE.</span></h2>

<p>There is one more piece of work done by our society
which yet remains to be described, and that is the cantilever
bridge. This we all voted to be the greatest of our achievements
on the island. To be sure, it was Uncle Ed&#8217;s design,
but I think we justly deserve credit for the masterful way in
which it was erected. In our search for types of bridges
before building the king post bridge, we came across a simple
cantilever bridge that didn&#8217;t look very difficult to construct.
To be sure, none of us knew a thing about stresses and
strains, and ingenious though we were, Bill realized that the
task of designing a cantilever bridge was far beyond him.
Nevertheless, we were sure we could build one if only we
had a good set of plans. A letter was therefore mailed to
Uncle Ed, asking him for the required details. The answer
came promptly from Western Australia, asking us to send
him the exact width of the water we wished to span, the
depth of the water, the distance from the top of one bank
to the top of the other, and the exact height of the banks
above water level. We decided we would build the bridge
across the mouth of the lagoon. The distance here between
the two banks measured a little over 60 feet. The banks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
were very precipitous, and rose 13-1/2 feet above the level of
the water. All these details, together with soundings of the
bottom, all the way across, were sent to Uncle Ed, and on
the day after our railway was completed quite a bulky package
was received in answer. It contained complete directions
for building the bridge of wooden frames, which were so designed
that they needed merely to be hooked together to
form the bridge, though to make the structure perfectly safe
Uncle Ed cautioned us to tie the frames together wherever
they met.</p>

<p>I am half afraid to tell my readers how to build this
bridge, as it required the utmost care, and had to be built just
so to avoid disaster. Bridge building is a serious business,
and I would not advise any one to attempt building this, of
all bridges, who does not propose to follow instructions implicitly.
Uncle Ed told us that if we built it properly, and
with sound timbers, we would find the bridge strong enough
to support a dozen boys, but he warned us not to crowd more
than that number on it.</p>

<p>The frames with which the cantilever bridge was built
were made of saplings from 3 to 4 inches in diameter. We
procured them from Mr. Schreiner&#8217;s lands up the river. In
making the frames the sticks were fastened together with
1/2-inch bolts 6 inches long. It was quite a strain on our
pocketbooks to buy these bolts, but Uncle Ed had written
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
that nails or spikes would
be useless to stand the
strains of so large a
bridge, and that if we

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
could not get any bolts
we had better give up the
idea of building a cantilever
bridge. To make
sure that we made no
mistakes, Uncle Ed had
made a drawing of each
different size of frame we
would need, designating
each with a different letter,
and then these same letters
were marked on a general
view of the bridge, so that
we would know exactly
where the frames belonged.
These drawings are reproduced
here in Figs. 305 to
316 and 318. We had to
<span class='image-left'>
<a id='link_i324'></a><img src='images/fig-307.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 307. C Frame (make four).
</span>
</span>
make four frames each, of
the <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> and <i>E</i> sizes,
two each of the <i>F</i>, <i>G</i> and <i>L</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
sizes and one each of the <i>H</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>J</i> and <i>K</i> sizes. Of the <i>D</i>
frames two were made with the ends cut away on the outer
half, as illustrated in Fig. 308, and two were cut away at
the inner side, the reason for which will appear presently.
When fastening the timbers together
we cut notches in each
stick, as shown in Fig. 317.
The depth of each notch was
just one-quarter the diameter
of the stick; that is, the notch
was 3/4 of an inch deep in a
3-inch stick and 1 inch deep in a
4-inch stick. Care was taken not
to exceed this depth, for fear of
weakening the sticks. In the
case of frame <i>D</i>, the sticks were
not notched or mortised together.
It will be noticed that the measurements
are given to the inner
edges of the sticks in some cases,
and to the outer edges in others.
The reason for this, as Uncle Ed
explained it, was because the
<span class='image-right'>
<a id='link_i325'></a><img src='images/fig-308.png'  alt='' /><br />
<span class='image-caption'>
Fig. 308. D Frame (make four).
</span>
</span>
thickness of our sticks would
vary considerably, and it was
important that many of the measurements
be exact, otherwise the
frames would not fit into each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
other as they should. Another
thing to which he
called our attention was the
fact that frames <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>,
<i>H</i>, <i>K</i> and <i>L</i> were stiffened
with cross braces, while the
rest were not. The braced
frames, he wrote, were
those which would be under
a compression strain, while
the others would be under
tension; that is, when any
weight was placed on the
bridge it would push against
the ends of the braced
frames, trying to crush
them, but would pull on the
unbraced frames, trying to
tear them apart. In fact,
the bridge would have been
just as strong had we used
heavy iron wire in place of
the unbraced frames, and
the only reason Uncle Ed
did not recommend our
doing so was because we
had no simple way of
stretching the wire taut.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>We built the complete set of frames before attempting to
erect the bridge. Then we began by building the towers.
Two <i>A</i> frames were set on end and spaced 4 feet apart at the
top and 5 feet apart at the bottom, measuring not from the
inner but from the outer edges of the frames. In this position
they were connected by short spars, notched in place.

<span class='image-caption'>

</span>
</span>
The notches for these connecting spars will be seen in Fig.
305 on the main or vertical timbers of frame <i>A</i>, just below
the upper and middle cross sticks and above the lower cross
sticks. The upper connecting spars were wedged tightly
under the cross sticks, and served as an additional support
for them. Diagonal braces were nailed from one frame to
the other, as illustrated in Fig. 318. The towers were built

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
on opposite banks, at the mouth of the lagoon, and when
completed we lowered them carefully down the banks into
the water. According to directions they were to be set just
30 feet apart, measuring from the center of one tower to
the center of the other. The water was quite shallow where
the towers rested, but the bottom was
pretty firm. Holes were dug in the
bottom for the legs of the tower to set
into, and then large stones were piled
around each leg to provide a firm
foundation for the towers.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>A <i>B</i> frame was now hauled out to one of the towers and
lifted by its narrower end, with fall and tackle, until its lower
tie piece rested on the projecting ends of the center crosspieces
of the tower. The upper end of the frame was held
against the top of the tower, while a <i>C</i> frame was hooked
over the upper ends of the tower legs; then frame <i>B</i> was
allowed to swing outward until its smaller end locked with
the outer end of frame <i>C</i>. It will be observed in Fig. 306
that the upper crosspiece or tie piece of frame <i>B</i> was fastened
to one side of the vertical sticks and the lower tie piece to
the other side. This was done purposely, so that when the
frame was set in position the bottom tie piece would be on
the lower side of the frame and the top piece would lie on
the upper side, as shown in Fig 318, or, better still, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
Fig. 319. The rest of the frames were all arranged to be set
in place with their tie pieces on the lower side, or facing the
towers, as will be clearly understood by examining the illustrations.
As soon as the <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> frames were set up on one
side of the tower, another pair of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> frames was set
up on the other side of the same tower. A cantilever bridge
must always be built out on both sides of the tower at the
same time, otherwise it will be overbalanced on one side and
topple over. After the <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> frames were in place we
took two <i>D</i> frames, with oppositely cut ends, and rested their
tie sticks on the top of the tower, just under the ends of the
<i>C</i> frames. The ends of the two <i>D</i> frames overlapped at the
center of the tower, and, as one was cut away at the outer
side and the other at the inner side, they fitted neatly together
and were fastened with bolts. The <i>D</i> frames were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
supported near their outer ends with <i>E</i> frames, which rested
on the <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> frames. Fig. 319 shows an <i>E</i> frame set in
position on the landward side of the tower, while two of the
boys are climbing out on the opposite <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> frames preparatory
to setting up the other <i>E</i> frame. A cross stick was
now bolted to each <i>D</i> frame, just beyond the upper ends of
the <i>E</i> sticks. This done, the frame <i>F</i> was hooked in between
the ends of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, at the shoreward side of the tower, and
its outer ends were supported by frame <i>G</i>, which was hooked
over frame <i>D</i> and the upper ends of frame <i>E</i>. The frame <i>L</i>
was then rested on the ends of frame <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, and supported
the shore end of frame <i>D</i>. A stick nailed across frame <i>D</i> on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
each side of the upper ends of frame <i>L</i> served to hold the
latter in place.</p>

<p>As the different frames were coupled together, we bound
the overlapping ends with soft iron wire. The place where
frames <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> came together was quite a vital point,
and we took pains to make the wire binding at this place
doubly strong. As soon as the <i>L</i> frame was in place we
anchored the bridge to shore by running wires from the
ends of the <i>D</i> frame and the ends of the <i>G</i> frame to stakes
driven into the banks. The frames on the second tower were
now similarly erected and anchored, after which we were
ready to put in the center panels of the bridge.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>The Center Panels of the Bridge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>First, the frame <i>H</i> was wedged into place and thoroughly
fastened by a liberal winding of wire. Next the frames <i>I</i> and
<i>J</i> were set in place, and in order to do this we had to remove
the upper tie pieces of these frames. Then one frame was
hooked in the other, and the two were carried out on the
scow under the center of the bridge. Ropes were tied to the
ends of the two frames, and they were lifted together, like a
wide <i>V</i>, to the position shown in Fig. 318, after which the tie
pieces were bolted on again, resting against the ends of the <i>E</i>
frames. As an additional security, two sticks were bolted to
the under side of the frame <i>H</i>, one at each side of the <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>
frames. The bridge was then completed by wedging the
frame <i>K</i> under the ends of the <i>D</i> frames, and also placing a
stick across each tower under the joints of the <i>D</i> frames.
We planned to run our gravity railway across this bridge,
moving our platform and trestle to the opposite bank; so
instead of flooring our bridge with slabs, we fastened ties
across at intervals of 15 or 18 inches. These ties were sticks
3 inches in diameter, which were secured to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
the <i>D</i> frames.</p>

<p>We were just preparing to lay the tracks across the bridge
when we met with a serious interruption. Mr. Halliday had
told us that a few days before our arrival that summer Mr.
Smith, the owner of the island, and another man had paid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
a visit to the place. Jim Halliday himself had rowed them
over, and learned from their conversation that Mr. Smith
was trying to sell the island, and that the stranger, a Mr.
Gill, was a prospective purchaser. All summer long we had
been dreading the return of this customer, though, as time
passed without his putting in an appearance, we almost forgot
the incident. But now, at the end of August, just as we
had about completed our cantilever bridge, who should
arrive but this very man Gill and three other men with a
large tent and camping outfit. It was a sorrowful crowd of
boys that watched the wagon with their belongings ford the
shallow water over to our island. We felt that the island
was ours by right of discovery and occupation, but we were
powerless to force our claims. And what if they did not
insist on our leaving the island? It would not be the same
place with strangers around to meddle with our things.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Dispossessed.</p>

<p>But the new owner of the island was even more of a boor
than we had anticipated. As soon as he landed he wanted
to know what we were doing on his property, and peremptorily
ordered us off. Bill answered that we were camping
there, and politely asked if we couldn&#8217;t stay out the summer.
But Gill would not listen to the idea. We must get off the
island that very day or he would see to it that we did.</p>

<p>I tell you it made us boil. We were just itching to give
the pompous little man the sound thrashing he deserved, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
knew that we would stand a very small show against his
three powerful companions. At any rate, we were determined
not to leave at once. Instead, we repaired to Kite Island,
taking our belongings with us. Then we cut away the suspension,
spar and pontoon bridges, so that we would not be
annoyed by any of the Gill crowd. We were resolved that
they should not benefit by any of the things we had built.</p>

<p>At the dead of night we paddled back to Willow Clump
Island, crept past the slumbering intruders and waded out
to the old water wheel. After a good deal of exertion we
managed to dislodge the smaller tower, letting the wheel
drop into the river and float away. Then we made for the
cantilever bridge. It didn&#8217;t take us very long to cut away the
wire bindings, unhook the frames and drop them into the
lagoon. But the task was quite a perilous one, as the night
was pitch black. Finally, nothing remained of the bridge
but the two towers, which were left as monuments to mark
the spot where our last piece of engineering on the island
was done.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Farewell to Willow Clump Island.</p>

<p>We spent several days on Kite Island, knowing that we
were safe from intrusion, because the Gill crowd had but
one boat, and that was on the Jersey side of the island. We
felt confident that they would not take the trouble of wading
around Point Lookout with their boats, as we had done;
nevertheless, to prevent a surprise, we kept a sentry posted
on the Lake Placid side of the island and gathered a pile of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
stones for ammunition. But our fun was spoiled, and we
finally decided to break camp and bid farewell forever to
Willow Clump Island and its vicinity. Our goods were
ferried over to Jim Halliday&#8217;s farm, where we were given
shelter. The windmill, as I have already stated, was sold
to a farmer at Lumberville, and we were kept busy for
several days carting it over and setting it up in place. When
everything had been done we stole back to Kite Island and
set fire to the log cabin. The next day Mr. Schreiner took
us home in a couple of his wagons. Thus ended our &#8220;investigation,
exploration and exploitation of Willow Clump
Island.&#8221; The work of two summers was practically all destroyed
in a few days.</p>

<p class='c mt20 mb10 b cb'>Reddy&#8217;s Cantilever Bridge.</p>

<p>I believe I have given a careful account of everything that
was recorded in the chronicles of the society. We were too
discouraged to undertake anything new in the two weeks before
school opened. I presume I might mention here Reddy&#8217;s
cantilever bridge, which, however, had really nothing to
do with the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I., because our society
was formally disbanded the day before Bill and I returned
to school. About a month after leaving home I received
a letter from Reddy inclosing three interesting photographs,
which are reproduced herewith. Reddy certainly had the
bridge fever, because soon after we had left he started to
work, with the rest of the boys, on a cantilever bridge across
Cedar Brook. The brook was entirely unsuited to such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
structure, because the banks were very low; but he made the
towers quite short and built an inclined roadway leading up
to the top of them. The legs of the towers were driven
firmly into the bank, making them so solid that he thought
it would be perfectly safe to build the frames out over the
brook without building them at the same time on the shore
side. But he had made a miscalculation, for when a couple
of the boys had crawled out on the <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> frames to set up
an <i>E</i> frame the structure commenced to sag. The trouble
was remedied by propping up the tower with a stout stick
driven into the river bottom and wedged under the upper
tie piece of the tower. The towers were really too short to
make a well proportioned bridge, for the panels had to be
made very long and narrow, so as to reach across. But on
the whole it was a very creditable structure when completed,
though it had only half as long a span as our cantilever bridge
over the lagoon.</p>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
